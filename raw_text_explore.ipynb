       "[\"...... Your concern is unnecessary. Lin Qingyan, what do you mean by this? You know I'm not referring to that. You were waiting here from sun-up, so you could hold me from visiting those three. You have to have some reason for me. Lin Qingyan! ...... ...Auntie. Why do you always bring this out to stifle me? It's not as if you're an honest relative. You're just relying on the friendship between the Lins and my dad, and being a generation older. Just why did the Tianshi Bureaus have you make this trip? How nice for the common people. If that's the case, will you really just ignore... will you really just carry on like this? ...... No one sent me. I volunteered myself. What? Don't you believe me? This is my first time hearing that the impartial, incorruptible, honest, forthright Lin Qingyan of the Central Judicial Office has learned to speculate on the bureaucracy's murky secrets. Don't rumors say you're sick of giving those sorts of shameless busybodies the time of day? That if anyone tries to wag on at you, you shock their brain numb? This, right now, is far from your style. ...Tch. I did not. You misheard, Auntie. But... ...... Understood. I will accompany you back.   I am Zuo Le, a... court Messenger. We will leave it at that.   Ms. Kroos, Mr. Nothing. Please accept my apologies.   I understand the transgression was Uncle Taihe's, but allow me to remind you:   If you are not too involved with those sisters, I suggest you put an end to that relationship while you still can.   To tell the truth... You've likely already crossed the line.   Heh.   Ms. Kroos, you're a woman of extraordinary courage and skill.   Now we have other business to attend to. Please excuse us.   If things were really so simple, then I would find myself worried about Mr. Liang's eye for talent.   Mr. Zheng, do we know anything about the visitor from Lungmen yet?   Anything special about him?   That's my father's greatest worry taken care of.   True though, considering the sort of methods that Lord Wei of Lungmen usually employs... If he were involved, we wouldn't be sitting here enjoying tea right now.   I'm surprised that you'd show such a keen interest in someone like him.   I see. It's true that he's a swordsman... As for his swordsmanship, though, all I know is rumors.   In any case, can we assume it was Mr. Liang himself who chose to involve the Lungmenite?   Hm... He is the only remaining variable, and also Mr. Liang's only trump card.   Mr. Liang doesn't have much of a choice himself. If only... *Sigh*... No, it wouldn't have mattered.   Isn't her presence in Shangshu the reason everything has gotten so out of hand?   The legends of Shangshu have always been so magnificent.   The Operator from the medical company... Kroos, was it?   If it wasn't for your help, she would likely have caught up to me. You have my thanks, Mr. Zheng.\",\n",
       " \"At the end of the day, Rhodes Island is an unknown. What do you think, Innkeeper?   They are nonetheless standing very close to the table.   And what's your assessment?   Hoh? Did you arrive at that conclusion as Zheng the Innkeeper or Zheng Qingyue, the Asker to the Frost?   You haven't once looked away from that fake cup.   ......   From what I heard, the Sui Regulator once secretly commissioned the renowned Xingyu Escort Association to transport an item, only for it to be lost in an accident en route.   I'm afraid I'm not very good with comforting words, Mr. Zheng.   How did you escape then, Mr Zheng?   Oh... The incident you were just talking about, of course. My father always tells me that I am still young and inexperienced, and should learn from my elders.   If you would continue to share your story with me, I'll gladly listen.   Regarding Miss Du...   No, she's your family. I am in no position to meddle in your household affairs.   How many inns and restaurants have you opened here in your town?   Not at all. My father always tells me what youngsters like me lack isn't persistence or conviction. It's an understanding of everything that surrounds us.   ......   Thank you for your advice.   ......   ......   Hello, sir. How may I help you?   Did all of you lose your wallets together?   ......   It has been a while since my blade was last unsheathed. How could it possibly rust?   Of course... Rhodes Island has gotten too involved.   Here's a Yanese idiom you might like, Miss Kroos. 'Justice casts a wide net.'   A medical company that strives to rescue all Infected and sees them as equals, regardless of their race, status, and wealth—   —Even the purest of mountain springs must be no match for Rhodes Island in purity.   Oh, please don't get the wrong idea... I didn't mean that as a threat.   After all, if Rhodes Island was a dishonest organization, you two would be in jail right now.   In other words, I would like you two to see our current situation as a form of trust.   However, Infected should not be wandering about in such a bustling part of town out in the open. Safety remains a concern, after all.   Would you follow me? Let's take this somewhere else.   Very well. I see you two are of formidable talent as well. I'll wait for you at the top of the tower to the north in a quarter hour.   You truly are a swift one, Miss Kroos. The innkeeper wasn't kidding.   Where is the man with the fan?   How peculiar... I thought you would send him, while you hide in the shadows.   As the saying goes, one should sacrifice a pawn to save one's queen. Not only are you the 'queen,' you're a crossbowman and an escape artist.   Even so, you came personally.   And yet you still have a mind for danger, especially when you have to go it alone, don't you?\",\n",
       " \"Haha... so temperamental. Forget I said anything, then.   I'll get to the point. We've looked into Rhodes Island a little. With so little time, we didn't dig up a lot of information.   I don't claim to fully know you, but at least know you can be trusted.   You must put the right people to the right job. Oripathy is a misfortune that all Infected face. What does that have to do with their responsibilities or skills?   I would like Rhodes Island to do us a favor.   No, in fact, if you don't help us, then I'm afraid you'd be making an enemy of us.   No wonder he thinks so highly of you.   You know of 'Sui?'   Oh... Looks like you're not lying, though you know only half the story.   Considering you see Nian and Dusk as friends... and that she told you about this much, they must see Rhodes Island as a lifeline of sorts.   In years past, so long as they stayed in line and broke no rules, the Sui Regulator would turn a blind eye to whatever they did.   But nowadays, things are different.   Not only are the times changing, you are on friendly terms with Nian, and you even brought Dusk off her mountain. That put you on the Sui Regulator's wrong side.   I know you meant no ill will, but what comes next?   How is Great Yan meant to know that they are not planning anything when they are all in one place?   I'm not trying to exaggerate.   Nian and Dusk disappeared not long after they reached Shangshu, and it just so happens that a goblet associated with them made its way here around the same time. Furthermore, the man of the hour is on Rhodes Island's side.   This is a tremendous coincidence. Wouldn't you say so, Miss Kroos?   And I'm not one to believe in coincidences.   You make it sound like we don't want to share.   They may take different forms, but all nations approach the same problem in their own way. Everyone faces this issue.   Though, because of certain... historical reasons, Great Yan's Sui Regulator happens to be at the forefront of 'Feranmutology.' Always has been. Always will be.   Kjerag still worships them as gods and Sami attempts to coexist with them, but the Sui Regulator's research has advanced to unparalleled heights.   Did Nian tell you about those legends? The old emperor, the wild hunt, and what they uncovered?   In ancient times, the people thought of certain creatures as 'gods,' and with civilization's advancement, they gradually began to go into hiding.   The 'Sui' is one such creature.   Whether they actually meet the definition of a living being is up for debate, and I don't suppose we need to go there.   All you need to know is that when at last they come to bring destruction to the world, Yan has the power to annihilate them. That's all.\",\n",
       " \"This is not exactly confidential Sui Regulator information, but it's not exactly common knowledge either.   I'm telling you all this not because I want a scholarly discussion.   Nian, Dusk, and the one who's in hiding somewhere in Shangshu. All of them are under the Sui Regulator's surveillance.   Normally, these things would not happen at such a pace. But then one day, the clouds all dissipated from that mountain. By the time the Sui Regulator Candleholders arrived, Dusk was nowhere to be found.   It took only a few days for the Candleholders to brief the court on this matter too.   Rhodes Island is getting itself involved without knowing the whole picture. The ignorant are blameless. On the contrary, it's unimaginable that you would work with those two without knowing anything.   And now, we would like Rhodes Island to follow the Sui Regulator's arrangement and persuade the Lungmenite to surrender the goblet himself.   Correct.   You call the magistrate by name, but gave the Lungmenite a courtesy title. That shows you are a good person.   Please don't get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to beat around the bush. All I'm saying is that you aren't hiding your trust in the Lungmenite anymore. Is it because of his partnership with Rhodes Island?   There aren't many people we can truly call friends. It seems Nian and Dusk are your friends too.   I'm afraid that's more than what Rhodes Island needs to know.   There's nothing to hide. It's just a more elegant way to go about this to save our mandarins some face.   Now that I've told Rhodes Island so much, can we set aside our differences and negotiate?   We'd like Mr. Lee's too.   The elimination of the Sui.   You're back, Uncle?   How were things?   If she was so ready to display etiquette, that shows there's still room for mediation.   This is regardless of how she acts, or what intentions she harbors. Master Tai's instructions lie here, and they can't be false.   Very well.   If we really do want everyone to trust that our methods can forever rid Yan of the sword hanging over her head, then we naturally must obey those magic words—   —Frank and forthright.   Close call.   Are you hurt, sir?   No need to be so cold, Uncle Taihe...   Wherever the goblet goes, Waregeists spring up. Ironically, it's proving the Sui Regulator's conjectures.   Does this mean...   As you instruct, Uncle Taihe.   *Sigh*...   Take a look at these Waregeists. How many incidents like this have we had?   While we have wrongdoers wreaking havoc with Originium Arts on occasion, things really don't come any better than this.   But Sui in the end is Sui, and a beast in the end is a beast. If your people carry intent to harm the realm, then Heaven knows how great the disaster will be.   The Sui Regulator has no desire to see such things come to pass.   Which is why we need to settle this millennium-long mess swiftly and cleanly.   ...No more than detritus.   Mr. Nothing.\",\n",
       " \"Please, convey this to Ms. Kroos for me. I want her to reconsider what I've said.   We can be on good terms regardless. Even if she should ultimately have her own considerations, my side still has a matter it wishes to entrust to Rhodes Island irrespective of position.   Haha... well, at that moment...   I was a little tensed up. I didn't get everything out.   Well, then... It seems we can't delay any longer. Mr. Nothing, we bid you farewell.   Master Shang. Do you have any idea what that thing on your belt is?   Yes and no, but we hope you'll hand it to us.   We've heard some rumors.   If your first reaction is to think of Sir Zheng, then presumably you know where we came from?   But it seems like those things and the item at your waist are unrelated.   I imagine you'll find absolutely no purpose in this cup.   But to we of the Sui Regulator, the cup has tremendous use.   Bait.   Those who bring ruin to the nation and its people.   That's need-to-know.   However, we ask you to believe us. Entrust the goblet to us, and you'll have done a justice great as the heavens.   I fear that's not for you to decide, Master Shang.   Get the goods before anything! Don't let him keep you!   Uncle Taihe...!   You couldn't catch him?   He's using the goblet as a threat, forcing Innkeeper Zheng to meet with him.   Is there no leeway?   The Field of Forgotten Water, was it?   We need to seize the opportunity.   Hm.   Very much a happenstance.   The goblet.   There's no point in hiding it now. Yes.   And someone unaccounted for has it.   If I told you, would you assist us in taking it back, Ms. Kroos?   ......   Are you asking us, Ms. Kroos, or... interrogating us?   This goblet was made by the hands of a great offender.   You treat them as your 'operators.'   ......   A fearsome beast dwells in this goblet. It's only a portion of his consciousness, of course.   I'm within my rights. If any ensuing liability falls on the Sui Regulator, you needn't have mercy, Uncle Taihe. Apply the legal proceedings.   Contemporary feranmutologists are in consensus that, aside from some form of corporealized body, walking in land beyond land, this ancient colossus also has means to dwell within certain objects.   The ancient literary saying, 'the beast walks with the generous earth,' actually gives some pointer as to these creatures' characteristics.   Weapons are fairly common. Whether it's ancient Sarkaz swords or modern, mass-produced staves, we have precedent.   But as for the concrete principle, we're still not sure.   Wherever it goes, Waregeists spring up. We can't say we're certain yet, but we have grounds to suspect it.   The cup is alive, yet it hasn't come to life. The objects around it are all dead, yet live because of it.   It's been adrift for a long time. It's by a random chance we were able to determine its location.\",\n",
       " \"No.   I said, just now, its maker was guilty. But its present master is someone else entirely.   A poet.  Mr. Zheng!  Thank you, sir.  Taihe.  Miss Du, what's your business here?  Why not?  ......  Miss Du, you should know we handle affairs impartially.  Please, step aside.  Then you'll have to excuse me!  —The Yin-ch'ing Fan of the Liens. As fine a kung fu as expected.  I'm fine.  So Rhodes Island doesn't intend on assisting the Sui Regulator?  A beast's heart is hardly fathomed. What can her character be worth?  Uncle Taihe, You help the innkeeper out.  I'll search for the cup. It can't wait any longer.  ...Oh.  Rain?  Ah! It's that Lungmenite!  Are the Waregeists surrounding him...? Hold on, who's that next to him?  Nian...!  I am Zuo Le, Candleholder of the Sui Regulator of Great Yan. By Master Tai's instruction, I am confidentially investigating Dusk and the black goblet's whereabouts.  You're swift.  ......  It's none of your concern.  But if you're showing of your own accord, then all the better...  Where is she?  Stop playing the fool!  What?  There's nothing in the Field of Forgotten Water. It's no different than an ordinary mountain.  —! Don't touch that cup—!  —  Firstly, I need you to give an explanation for Dusk's departure.  Ms. Kroos persists in regarding you as a Rhodes Islander. Thus, all three of you here have some relation to the company.  In accordance with your answers and this incident's resolution... I will consider penning a letter to the imperial court, with grave regard to this matter.  No. Any time the twelve of you meet, exchange messages or converse is a major strain on the Sui Regulator's nerves. How can you be ignorant of that?  You've been idle for too long. The human realm has gone through changes.  Where's Dusk? And where's Ling?  And what intent do you three have, assembling in Shangshu? And what secrets... does this goblet hide?  You know the significance of us necessitating it be in the Sui Regulator's hands—  You're well-aware. Then it's exceedingly hard to consider any of you here unaware or innocent.  The Feranmut is not only able to separate parts of itself into proxies with independent personalities, but can store its consciousness within certain mediums in order to roam...  But can your proxies really do the same thing over again? Just as if you were an Ursus matryoshka.  Wouldn't he go mad?  Meeting with him would be the greatest taboo.  What about Dusk? What did you seek Dusk for? And why did you come here after doing so?  According to the records, you're always full of ideas.  Are you aware of what you're saying?  Are you going to kill yourself?  Is Its mind not your minds?  All nonsense.  What ideas do you have?  I'm only obligated to hear out your idea. Whether I trust it, or not, is the Sui Regulator's decision.\",\n",
       " \"A year ago, Yan realized something.  Victoria's incidents. Ursus's endless unrest. One of Leithanien's Empresses losing her voice.  All under heaven was in turmoil, and Yan had to prepare.  The court met day after day, and passed the 'Twenty-Eight Policies.' Nothing unaccounted for, and not solely seeking the safety of Yan, but offering survival to the known world.  But outside of the Twenty-Eight Policies published, there were still hidden two more that needed Yan's urgent decision.  The Grand Tutor has met with that great offender.  The Grand Tutor mends the realm's affairs, inspecting for leaks and patching holes.  Angry?  Would you show anger at a rascally child who blames the sky for raining?  The Grand Tutor gave the Sui Regulator a hidden aim. Something that must be accomplished, whether or not we openly chafe with the Ministry of Rites for it.  Three things.  First, retrieve the goblet. We don't know why, but he spilled all to the Grand Tutor as to the cup's origins and rough whereabouts.  Second, aside from preserving the two hidden policies, find an even more reliable proposal, to keep this situation suppressed to a minimum.  Third...  No matter who they are, should more than three proxies gather on one side, pass on personal handwritten instructions from the Grand Tutor.  Correct.  So, I ask, Where is Dusk?  This is my duty.  They'll simply do again what was done a millennium ago.  Moreover, now, we are strong, and your powers feeble.  The Sui Regulator's principles are simple. Finish it once and for all, and forever rid the future of plague.  You're only scheming to allow yourself escape.  Even if I believed you, why should I believe you can accomplish this preposterousness?  If you can't, then how much unnecessary danger will your existence engender? Doesn't the Sui Regulator have an even more 'dependable' plan to solve this problem?  You cannot convince me.  You must be...  What do you mean?  ......  You know how this goblet came about.  Hand it over.  You understand reason, Mr. Lee. You should know the severity of this.  If Ning Ciqiu doesn't give a reasonable explanation, Liang Xun will pay for his unilateral action.  ......  The last time the Sui Regulator neared that shrine, a body was discovered inside it.  It was Grandmaster Xiang Ru. Heart failure, died while vomiting blood. The weiqi board was empty, save for a single black stone at the center.  The Sui Regulator is investigating it.  But this goblet, without a doubt, is a crucial key to uncovering his plot. And the two of you, Miss Nian, Miss Dusk...  The Sui Regulator wishes for you to come with us.  In that case... how about Miss Ling?  The Sui Regulator records that he disagrees with all the other bestials, willing only to recite poetry and make merry with Ling and Shu.  If she still won't show herself, then the Sui Regulator's only option is to—  When did...  What did you just...\",\n",
       " \"This and that are independent. Even once you see his instructions, you must still behave and come with the Sui Regulator.  Indeed.  Take it.  My duty is solely to give the letter.  In that case... who are you?  I only know general strategy.  I've met you before, Assistant Minister Ning.  What does this match signify?  It's very hard not to.  The state of things is evident to all at this point. You don't need to carry on mystifying them.  This isn't a topic you can discuss here.  You have no freedom of movement. You shouldn't have seen the Grand Tutor before.  Uncle Taihe.  I met the offender.  But if we truly take him at his word, then the three face their own self-shackles at this moment.  I just don't understand why the Grand Tutor would trust that offender.  If they fail, we'll be confronting their reflection here in Shangshu. Even if... it's only a small fraction.  ...Yes.  That's what my father hopes.  —!  The sky!  The shadows are taking form... Is this... Sui's reflection?  What is it... looking at?  What! It disappeared?  The Sui Regulator demands Nian and Dusk give an explanation.  Additionally, the three of you cannot act in concert. You must leave Shangshu under the Sui Regulator's supervision.  If Rhodes Island intends to attract even more scrutiny...  I thought the Central Judicial Office was unwilling to interfere in the Sui Regulator's affairs.  No wonder Miss Ning always held her fire... You persuaded Tianshi Bai beforehand.  But at what moment can the Tianshis take charge of this matter?  What?  ......  Miss Ning. Good to meet you.  We came uninvited and troubled you greatly. We should be first to apologize.  Your insight is as a beacon, Miss Ning.  But Mr. Liang's actions, breaking past settled positions, were all the more admirable.  As one should.  Here... here!  The former would require three days' effort. The latter would be mutual loss, with the feranmut dead, and three-tenths of the army gone.  —!  Uncle Taihe? So you long since...  Understood.  Shangshu's mountain ways are rugged. I fear it may be dangerous if you are alone...  No. I simply mind your advanced years. Be careful on lone outings, please...  So this bounty hunter really was yours, Assistant Minister Ning.  It was the Sui Regulator who hastened in its conduct; we won't question her deeply. Er... as long as she entered Yan's borders through legitimate means, of course...  You'd seen through both the Sui Regulator and Mr. Liang's schemes.  He may simply have been apprehensive about betraying you, Miss Ning.  Regardless, the Sui Regulator overstepped their bounds in this. We will later address the matter ourselves with the Ministry of Rites.  Farewell, Miss Ning.  ......  I can only hope this pair in love... aren't shaken by big things to come.  As a Candleholder, I've none of my own ties of the sort.  *cough*, *cough*—I trust that girl was only repaying the favor! How can you muddle this with affairs between the sexes?\",\n",
       " \"It was a life saved. If the intent was impure, that would only further serve doubts of advantage being taken.  You presume wrong, Uncle Taihe. Father is a busy man. I should not bother him at work. I don't. There's nothing for me to do at home anyway. I thought I might as well take a look around town. The Grand Tutor must have sent me to Yumen expecting something to happen. I should keep my eyes open. It's been years since the last time you were here, hasn't it, Uncle Taihe? It must bring back memories. The arena remains as popular as ever. You still rank fifth on the Board of Fame. Did something catch your attention? Ahem... The Grand Tutor says that a Candleholder's duty is to carry the fire that drives out the shadows of the Feranmut, and to travel amongst to people to learn their troubles. A sense of duty comes first, shrewdness second. Kung fu comes third or fourth at best. ...... So... How <i>do</i> I compare, then? Who goes there? Stop right there. Do you know where you are, and exactly what that sword you're holding is? ...... Let us set aside the question for the time being who it is you are working for and how you made your way in here. Hand over the sword. I'll take you to the Grandmaster. Impudence! The Grandmaster has defended Yumen's peace for a hundred years. How dare you speak ill of him?! I've arrested no small number of criminals, but you are the first one I've met to be so arrogant. I see I have no choice but to get you to comply forcefully, then. You're injured. Where can you run? Watch out, Grandmaster! It all happened too suddenly. I wasn't prepared, and I wasn't able to take the assassin in, as a result. It was a young female assassin who infiltrated us and took the sword. She was hurt when she made her escape. Aside from that... I'm afraid I don't have anything. Sir! Yes, sir! Are you the doctor, sir? I apologize for the interruption. We are investigating a case and pursuing a suspect. Here is my token. We would appreciate your cooperation in answering a few questions. Has this clinic treated or seen anyone who suffered serious a stab wound? I would like to take a quick look. It'll only take a minute. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the clinic's work. I would rather not have to force my way in. But this concerns the safety of all of Yumen. Your cooperation would be appreciated. Then I apologize. (This man is no ordinary brute!) ...... Do you understand the consequences of obstructing justice? Enough! This is not a game. There's someone else in there?! What the...? You said no heavily wounded patients were taken in lately. How do you explain the gauze and blood? Stop right there! He just disappeared? Sorry... What the—?! Who's there?!\",\n",
       " \"(Did he intentionally draw me here?) (A commotion here would...) (Where are you?) ......! Mr. Lee? I noticed. Did you...? No choice, I suppose... Let's get out of here. We don't want civilians getting hurt. Do you have an idea? Wait–– (Heavy panting) Q-Qiubai... it's been a while... ...... Why have you come? A friend I met on a previous mission... and an old acquaintance of Liang's. My life would have been in danger if not for your help. But are you really here by chance? No jokes, please. This is important. What else do you know about what happened in Yumen last night? ...... I stabbed the assassin in the scuffle last night, so I started my search in the clinics. I searched every single clinic in the city and didn't find anything unusual, until the last one. A man called himself a helper and would not let me in. I forced my way in and found gauze and blood. The man ran off with an agitated look on his face. I wasn't sure what to make of it. Obstruction of justice is a crime, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what the man was talking about. It didn't feel premeditated. Let me think... Feline, male. Looks to be in his forties... exceptionally skilled in kung fu. ...... What happened?! Tell me his condition first! Uncle Taihe shouldn't have been involved in this, he was helping me under the table... Where is Father? ...... Where are the ones who brought Uncle Taihe here? Tell me the truth. The city is under high alert right now. What were you doing out so late at night? So you live in the area, but heard nothing strange? Where did you find the wounded? The Sword Forge... No. Your testimony is unclear, so as a witness, you can't leave just yet. Millenion. I'm moving out. Gather your team. Search the Sword Forge. Father ordered me to hunt down the assassin and locate the sword in three days to restore peace in Yumen. Even with his strength, Monitor Censor Taihe has been gravely injured. This surely has some link to the Feranmut followers. Going to the scene of the crime to find the truth and arrest the culprit, is that not sticking to my post?! Go. ...... Oh? You're Xingyu Inn innkeeper Zheng's... When did you get to Yumen? And why? I'm investigating a case. Sounds like there <i>is</i> something suspicious about this place... ...... Please do not obstruct the investigation, assuming you have nothing to do with it. ...... You— Show yourself! –– Some Sword Forge! Just a hideout for gangs. ...... This is the Grandmaster's sword. Now that I have the sword, I won't pursue this particular matter any further, if you're not working with the Shanhaizhong. The matter of your trespassing into the barracks can wait. Qiubai. Yes. I can listen to your reproaches later, after we've taken care of these!\",\n",
       " \"It's getting hotter. It's only March, and it's night. How could the temperature be rising? Could it be the Sword Forge's Originium furnace... This sword... You were the one who attacked Uncle Taihe! Murder of a Messenger, attempted theft of Catastrophe data, attempted assassination of a court official. What do you think Yumen is, Shanhaizhong?! You know why Yumen is returning... Father tasked me to complete three tasks in three days: recover the Grandmaster's sword, catch the assassin, and track down the Shanhaizhong who have infiltrated the city. It turns out all the answers were right here in the Sword Forge. How dare you! Stop right there! ...... Out of my way! This is a Yumen military case. Anyone who interferes will be arrested. Impudence! Did you see the Shanhaizhong on your way here? Good. Round them up and take them into custody. They appeared right as the criminals retreated and obstructed our pursuit. They must be investigated thoroughly. All the rest have something to do with the case. The Sword Forge is linked to the Shanhaizhong. Given your ties to Meng Tieyi, I would have asked you to come with us regardless. As for you... This is no time for jokes. —! Take these people back to the barracks for questioning. I'll go after the Grandmaster's sword. Stop right there. If you're not in league with those criminals, why did you steal the sword? What is your connection to the man at the clinic? You don't understand what kind of trouble you've gotten yourself in. You've never lived in a nomadic city, and you know nothing about Yumen. Someone told you where the sword was and got you to steal it. But you don't understand what kind of trouble it would bring. Tell me. Things may still be salvageable. Even if the price is your life? Whatever the truth is, I can't sit aside and let you put yourself in danger. I'm trying to help you. I'm under orders to investigate. You're the one who stole the sword. You may have your reasons, but that's no excuse for distorting the truth. They tried to cover the Shanhaizhong's escape. All involved must be investigated until they are cleared of suspicion. We face the double threat of Catastrophe and criminals. I must abide by my duty to Yumen. This is my duty... ...... There's been a misunderstanding, sir. I ask that you return the sword to its rightful master. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say. ...... Ridiculous! How can something so important be determined so callously? I'm not fighting— ...... It just occurred to me that even if I let you go, you still need a way out. I grew up here. I was a mischievous boy who tried to sneak out of the city through the sand sluices, and was duly punished by my father for doing so. But only someone as stubborn as you would dare take this way.\",\n",
       " \"Tell me, did you come to Yumen just for this sword? And you wish to present the sword as an offering? And after that, will you return it? That eccentric from the clinic promised me earlier that if you broke your word, he would bring you back himself. But having said all that, retrieving the sword was, and still is, my duty. So while I have no qualms about taking you at your word, just this once, I <i>will</i> get that sword back, even if I have to jump into the sand sluice myself. 'Yi nuo qian jin.' You may not know the idiom, literally 'a promise worth a thousand gold.' Break your word, and I will drag you back here, personally. Three quarters past the Hour of Yu... the turbines should have slowed down by now, there's no time to waste. Get going! Found you... good thing your footprints weren't completely wiped away. You weren't lying about planning to come back to Yumen. To get the sword back. And to make sure you're safe. No time to talk about that. We need to get back to the city! You were lucky to survive the jump down the sand sluice. Your injuries will take a long time to heal, though. Here, hold on to me. –– I must be seeing things. There couldn't be anyone else out here at a time like this. Let's go. Grandmaster. Thank you for coming here to the Sword Forge. The sword has been found, but she insists on returning it to you personally. About Mr. Meng... ...... Still, my ill-considered actions have alienated the jianghu heroes of Yumen. I will speak to my father and accept any discipline, once this crisis has passed. And I will indemnify any losses suffered by the Sword Forge, as well as the costs of any repairs. ...... I did what had to be done. My conscience is clear. I'm sure you understand that the Shanhaizhong are even more dangerous to Yan than the Feranmuts. The Feranmuts may be powerful, but we won the hunt a thousand years ago. Yan is even stronger now. There is nothing to fear. What is truly frightening is the shadow that had been cast on people's hearts since time primordial. Heaven and earth, the moon and stars, wind and rain, the changing of the seasons... it is unfathomable, beyond our reckoning. The Feranmuts were the same to the people of the time. Ignorance breeds fear, which becomes twisted into religion. To those madmen, we are the ones we are the outsiders. We are the traitors.\",\n",
       " \"The Shanhaizhong's activities never waned, even after the Feranmuts faded from the public eye. In the past centuries, they have absorbed bandits, pirates, robbers, and other sorts of villains. They use the Feranmuts as a shadow to conceal their activities. Sui Regulator records indicate that the Shanhaizhong have done unmeasurable harm in the name of the Feranmuts. The scale of their deeds is so widespread that complete elimination is impossible, and the vileness of their acts horrifying. They have started to reach out to the proxies of your kin. They were thankfully foiled by the timely intervention of the Sui Regulator. However, the Sui's true form stirs from slumber, Yumen returns to its motherland, and the Shanhaizhong have infiltrated the city. It is a complex web, too complex to be a coincidence. All under Heaven is the offender's Go board. The Shanhaizhong may simply be a piece in his game. ...... Or perhaps, the Shanhaizhong have already made contact with the Sui. Yes. Yes. ...Yes. ...... ...... ...For all the people. ...... Thank you for your guidance, Grandmaster.\"]"

'They were your real parents.... and they died protecting you.'   The funny thing is, I don't know them at all. I don't have any memories of them in my mind other than that vision.   My own parents were just forgotten. It's hard for me to even say I have any feelings for them.   ........\",\n",
       " '  Half and half. The other half was the blood of the Ursus Infected.',\n",
       " \"  Ugh....   I was born in a mine in the northwest tundra.   The mine was small and remote, not part of any city, and there are with no settlements around. There was nothing to see but snow all year round.   This mine was hell, built only to spread death and slavery. There are countless such mines in the snowy plains.   My birth parents were miners in that hellish pit.   My grandmother stayed with me through my early years of learning to speak, but she never told me what crimes my parents committed to be sentenced to mine labor.   Later, when I was a little older, I asked around in the mines and learned that both of my parents had opposed the Emperor's wartime plans.   Their arrest was also an accident. The bottom two lines of the arrest warrant were blank, so the sergeant in charge of the search haphazardly copied the name on the door plate.   Without trial, my parents lost their names and moved from their warm little town to the cold Northlands to serve a centuries-long sentence.   Of course, no one would even live to see that, let alone ever leave alive.   My grandmother was sentenced to the mines together as a 'harborer' of criminals, and moved with them.   In fact, all the miners there had very similar experiences.   Naturally, both of my parents contracted Oripathy down there. All the miners did.   Now, even if you escaped this mine, no one would believe a word you said. You're just an Infected person, the most horrible, vicious and extreme of the Oripathy patients.   However, the overseer of the mine, a certain Ursus military garrison, believed that the natural death rate of the Infected was still too slow.   They drew straws to decide the fates of the Oripathy sufferers, killing them for fun and sport.   Maybe it was the miners that drove them crazy, rather than the snow. And maybe the Infected didn't count as human in their eyes.   When I was five, my parents drew the black lot.   When I was ten, my grandmother drew the black lot.   When I was eleven, I drew the black lot myself, but it didn't matter, they didn't care about the lottery anymore. They just want to abandon the whole mine.   By that time, all the adult Infected in the mines had died out, and the Emperor's new policies had left the mines starved of people.   Under orders, the Ursus overseers prepared to go ahead and execute the last of the Infected.... A few sick children.   Afterwards they would collapse the mines to serve as mass graves for the infected, to cover up their sins.   I learned later, in my travels, that they do this all the time.   I was sad. I was in pain.   I had broken a lot of ore. I lived with other kids in the mines, we loved each other, and we were all going to die for nothing.   Strong feelings hatched in my chest, the deaths of both my parents and my grandmother played vividly in my mind.   When the execution started, my Arts erupted from within me, killing the four soldiers carrying out the execution..   Of course, I didn't have the power to turn things around.   The children were mere cattle to the overseers, who, as soldiers, carried sharp blades and wore solid armor, and we were like bugs who just managed to sting them.   The cries of my siblings reached my ears just as they knocked me to the ground and the final wave of slaughter was about to begin...   A guerrilla band arrived.   That was Buldrokkas'tee's team.   All the Ursus soldiers guarding the Infected on the northern tundra have dreams, and this squad is their worst nightmare.\",\n",
       " \"  If I could be, I would be.   They killed every last executioner right before us, and the Infected children in the mine escaped.   It's just...   The blood of my less fortunate companions and that of the dead soldiers flowed together and crystallized into ice on the inhumanly white ground.   And I realized something, in that moment...   These Ursus soldiers were just following orders, at first. They shed the same blood as us.   Words and stories and fabricated animosity planted the root of cruelty and indifference in their bodies.   It was Ursus that turned them into this.   Hiss, hmm....   Please.... Do me a favor.   In the left pocket of my jacket, there's are some candies. Take one.   ...You can also take one for yourself if you want to try it.\",\n",
       " \"  Afraid it's poisoned?   Maybe you don't like candy, but you can try it. You can't get this kind of candy in Lungmen.   It's an Ursus specialty. Eat one, and there's one less in the world.   Consider it payback for helping me with the candy. Try it.   Oh? Looks like you've got a taste for snacks after all.   Just a warning, the sugar may be completely different from anything you've ever had before.   But life is short. You should try something new, right?\",\n",
       " '  Please put the candy in my mouth. Careful, not to touch my skin.',\n",
       " \"  From my fingertips to my neck, I'm paralyzed. I can only move from the neck up.   But I can still freeze you instantly with even the slightest movement of my tongue.   So don't worry. If you offend me, you'll be dead soon enough.\",\n",
       " '  Thank you.',\n",
       " '  ........',\n",
       " \"  The look on your face....   Hehehe....   Sorry, couldn't resist teasing you a bit.   I've made that joke so many times that no one falls for it anymore.   And now at last..... I saw a chance. Sorry, I just.... couldn't help myself.\",\n",
       " \"  ........   Because I'm cold.   I told you to be careful, because even if you touch just the tiniest bit of my skin, you'll get severe frostbite.   If you had touched me before, I would have been able to tell by your reaction. You didn't. You didn't try to kill me.\",\n",
       " \"  My cold goes even beyond winter itself.   The heat from the outside world cannot penetrate the bitter cold that surrounds my body. I love hot drinks because I can feel the warmth of the drink as the hot stream slides down my esophagus and into my stomach....   Sadly, my insides get burned by hot drinks.   The only pleasure I have left is this mix of alcohol and stimulating spices, with a little candy, if you can call it that.   This warm feeling, even if it's only a brief illusion, brings me a bit of comfort.   Sorry for teasing you earlier.\",\n",
       " \"  Oripathy created this horrible body of mine.   At that moment, however, Buldrokkas'tee held my ice cold body that had never known warmth close to his chest.   He didn't care at all that I'd frozen his unarmored arms to the point of partial necrosis.   I'm not sure if it was the emotions he was feeling at the time that infected me or not.... But I stayed awake and survived in the end.\",\n",
       " \"  He's my whole family. As a young child, he was all I had.   Like I said, I don't remember much about my birth father.... Subconsciously, I did indeed thought of the huge beast as my real family. Hard to say.   It's just that, despite his appearance, he's sentimental and stubborn in places, and isn't it funny that such a man used to be a killing machine for Ursus?   It's not funny, is it? I can't laugh either.   He was once a war hero of Ursus, who retired to a certain city-state in his old age.\",\n",
       " \"  If you don't take Ursus at their word, you'll see that he's in good company. Although, there is only one that the Infected call 'Patriot'.   His wife died young and he is survived by his son.   By the way, he's a Sarkaz. From the most vicious Sarkaz clan at that. Still, his son became a scholar, a Wendigo scholar.... Perhaps the first in the history of Ursus.   Buldrokkas'tee contracted Oripathy during his last battle.   His men helped him hide his illness, and he had even hidden everything from his own son. He didn't want to drag his son down with him, only to die in some dark corner of the world with the disease.   However, during the 'Great Rebellion', his son was campaigning for the rights of the Infected. Long out of touch with his father, the son still sees him as an Ursus puppet.   And he was. They commanded him to keep order in his own ranks at all costs. He allowed the soldiers to use their weapons, conflict erupted, and corpses piled in the snow drifts.   That's who he was.   Then he saw his son on the street, his body by then completely cold.   I wonder if he thought of his son when he hugged me?   His son fought for the Infected in his own way, and Buldrokkas'tee believed he had killed his own son.   His team left with him. Since then, the Northwest Tundra has had a guerrilla force that strikes fear into the hearts of Ursus who dare to abuse the Infected.   ........   The old beast never said a word of any of this to me.   He probably does think of me as his daughter. But I also want him to tell me this stuff, in his own words, to me.   I learned it all from his men. But Buldrokkas'tee himself won't speak to anyone.   That monster of a stubborn old man with a fragile and porous heart.   His team had passed through four mines before saving us children.   The kids in those four camps weren't as lucky as us. They found their bodies buried in the collapsed mines, and the company of soldiers that carried out the executions were nowhere to be found.   What did he find in me? Affection? Redemption? Or a little psychological comfort? I'm not sure.   ........*Cough*.\",\n",
       " '  Probably, maybe. Probably just the result of me overusing my Arts.   It got pretty intense today. This sort of thing has only happened once before.   Unconsciousness, general paralysis, and the inability to move around even when conscious, have all happened. I know my own body.',\n",
       " '  Oh are you going to fight for me now?   Rhodes Islander.... What do I call you?',\n",
       " \"  Dr. {@nickname}?   Dr. {@nickname}.   ...I admit that you Rhodes Islanders can fight. But I still don't trust you. Not to mention the fact that you're supposed to be a pharmaceutical company.\",\n",
       " \"  What happens outside of combat is none of my business.   I watched you fight in Chernobog. You have a strong stance, something I confirmed with my own eyes, but I couldn't judge your character.   ...I heard that Alex died at your hands. It makes me doubt your path.   Now, I can't let you leave Chernobog and cause more harm to Reunion's Infected.   But you're willing to listen to so much of my crap....   I'm going to assume you're not exactly as the other Infected describe.\",\n",
       " \"  Who wouldn't be afraid of the one who brings death?   Dr. {@nickname}, are you scared, right now??\",\n",
       " \"  It's normal to feel fear.   It means you still have attachment to the world, and you still have much to do.   Do you really feel fear?   I doubt it.   If you look so peaceful in the face of death, then I think maybe you really have no attachments at all.   Interesting. You are not scared?   I guess those who do not fear death have little love left for the world.   A question I think about all the time....   'Am I afraid of death?'   I've heard that the Ursus garrisons call me the Yeti Princess, the Wintry Death....   The truth is, we were just a few ragtag squads wandering the tundra, barely scraping by.   My Arts were powerful, I proved as much to my enemies and teammates alike.   Of course, my body, as you can see, is only that of an Oripathy sufferer.   I felt special, not because of my illness, but because of the feelings my frost instilled in me.   I saw my ability as a blessing, but Buldrokkas'tee, that grumpy old fart, treated it like a curse.   I couldn't feel the cold as we waded through the deep mud in the swamp, icy water soaking my legs.   The old man wouldn't let go into battle, even as his soldiers took heavy casualties.   He lit his oil lamp and sat quietly at the table by himself. I think he was crying, but I couldn't be sure, and I didn't know if I should comfort him.   In my fifth year, I summoned a cold stream for the first time in the face of the enemy.   One soldier was frozen into a block of ice, another accidentally fell on the block and they both shattered into pieces.   I joined the fight, the soldiers looked at me in awe, my brothers and sisters were proud of me, and other infected said——   'That's our big sister. She saved all our lives.'   Did my Arts actually save anyone?   The children from the mine carried the Originium crystals I had made, and we became the 'Yeti Squad'.   Those crystals radiate my cold, and we bring frost and vengeance to the enemies of the Infected.   But that's really... just cold. The cold of winter that won't birth new life.   Even so, I feel very lucky. For my brothers and sisters could survive.   We could live in this world.\",\n",
       " \"  Ordinary people....   What do you mean by ordinary people?   The unarmed but cold-eyed citizens of Chernobog who watch the infected being put to death? Or the Ursus conscripts in the mines who take pleasure in shooting us?   Every time I think of the faces of those overseers, I grit my teeth and fantasize about slitting their throats and drinking their blood....   ........   But I don't hate the Ursus.   As our guerrillas trudged through the snow, retreated from the valley, and were even chased by the Ursus army....   It was the Ursus who would put a few cups of breadbrew in their windows.   The Ursus have never been cold-blooded creatures. The only enemy I have is the Empire of Ursus that has tormented the Infected so.   I don't think of ordinary people as the enemy. Ursus who are taught to hate the Infected are just ordinary people until they are blinded by that hate.   It's only because 'enemies kill each other' that we've fought as we have. That's all.   I'm an Infected person, yes.... But before that, I was a normal person.\",\n",
       " \"  ...My main conflict with Buldrokkas'tee is in his work to protect the Infected community.   'Reunion, first name. That. Infected, can rely on.'   'No matter where, Reunion goes. No matter what, it does. We cannot, abandon it. To lose Reunion, is to lose, Infected conviction. Fight for: conviction.'   That's what the old man says. That's what the old man believes.\",\n",
       " \"  Because that's how he talks now. I was just, *ahem*, preserving his cadence..   Dr. {@nickname}, do you know why Rhodes Island is a nameless pharmaceutical company?   Because you can't take a stand on the world stage. As soon as you take that step, you'll become what Reunion is now.   You will go down this road.\",\n",
       " \"  Hmm.   After a dozen years of rolling around on the tundra, an Infected woman reached out to us. She said, 'Come with me, and let us break all chains.'   Imagine it: we met in the ruins of an old city that had become a battlefield. She was alone, carrying nothing but her roster and a book of ledgers.   Even the things she said I found impractical to the point of ridiculousness.   But she said to us, 'Come with me.'   She fought with us, and with her strength and ideals, she became our friend. Together we left the snowy plains and headed for the cities of Ursus.   Whether was the words she spat out after pausing to think, or the swing of her great sword as she slashed alongside me, her power was real, and plenty impressive.   When the wounded needed treatment, she was there. When discussing strategy and philosophy with the Infected, she was there. And when fighting against the Ursus death squads, she was also there.   ...We even get to dine with some regular people. She didn't care. There was nothing in her eyes but the purest authenticity.   Our team grew and so did our friendships. The people brought in were good at fighting, and they were good people.   At the time, I considered her my friend. She quietly helped me make these candies, even though she was terrible at it and they tasted worse.   She made a funny face as she ate them. Then she'd force a smile at me.   It was really something. She worked so hard to put on a brave face. It made me laugh.   Everything's different now.   Chernobog was destroyed by a Catastrophe, as you can well see. All the normal people here died or became newly Infected.   Their eyes were dead. No desire to live anymore whatsoever.   If this is what she wanted, then we never should have followed her.   And in case you didn't know, here's a secret....   She's planning to take over Lungmen. She says it won't be like Chernobog, and that the Infected will get their own city instead of a giant ruin like this place.   Would you trust someone like that?   If she's acting, then she's the greatest actress the world has ever seen.   But there's a thought stuck in my head.   'What are my chances of winning if I went up against her?'   Once we part ways, once I find out she's been lying to the Infected, or that she's been plotting against them...   I will fight her. She must know the price of betrayal.   My countless deadly battles with Ursus have cleansed my mind and honed my skills.   I say with the utmost conviction: even if I cannot defeat her, I can let death take her from the world along with me.   The stubborn old man wouldn't agree with me.

We don't know when the enemy may attack again.   Pass our location to all teams: We will guarantee a safe route for their retreat from here!   Keep evacuating.   What's going on?   ......   She is your child, yes?   Such a healthy one.   Don't be afraid. Don't cry. Your mama is right here.   Mama is here.   Get her out of here.   You *cough* escort her. See her to safety.   Oh?   Have some faith in your big sister.   Hurry! They're coming!   They are deploying some units wearing other uniforms... They might be Lungmen's L. G. D.!   *Cough* *cough* ... *hack*.   Go!   And the fighting... how goes?   You have nothing to hide.   And those uninfected Lungmenites we saw...?   ......   *Cough* *cough*...   ........   I'm awake.   You didn't kill me while I was unconscious. Is that confidence or something else?   In any case, you didn't.   ........   I'll take that as a sign that you've shown mercy. Now if I don't kill you, I'd call that returning the favor.   Why the consternation on your face?   Is it because...? You heard everything I saw in my dream?   It seems I really did reveal something very unpleasant in my stupor.   Memories are something you can't lose even if you want to.   Have you explored our surroundings?   Couldn't find a way out, could you?   Looks like we won't be able to leave this place for a while.   ........   My father, as I call him, is named Buldrokkas'tee and was once an officer in the Ursus military.   But my real father died a long time ago.   As a child I vaguely remember a man taking a crossbow bolt to protect a woman; and the woman took me in her arms and stopped the second volley of bolts with her spine.   I couldn't even comprehend what was happening at the time, and this memory just happened to never fade.   As for what really happened, it was my grandmother who told me all about it later.   When I pressed my grandmother for the meaning of that vision, and she had no more excuses, she told me.   'They were your real parents.... and they died protecting you.'   The funny thing is, I don't know them at all. I don't have any memories of them in my mind other than that vision.   My own parents were just forgotten. It's hard for me to even say I have any feelings for them.   ........   Half and half. The other half was the blood of the Ursus Infected.\""
