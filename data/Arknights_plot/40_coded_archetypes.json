The Army hasn't had a chance to engage in such operations since the Great Rebellion, but the Infected did.   The ancient nobility, closely watched as they were, couldn't have planned the Chernobog incident, but the Infected could.   Indeed, most of Reunion's Infected had no training, they didn't stand a chance against the Ursus Guard and the Chernobog riot police\u2014   But a Catastrophe did. Chernobog failed to split the plates in time, and there was nothing they could do against a Catastrophe.   Reunion had to infiltrate the city early to stop the security forces from mobilizing, while the Army ignored their maneuvering.   Lungmen and Rhodes Island anticipated Reunion's actions, and the L.G.D. made a plan to annihilate them, but Chernobog...   Even to this day, Chernobog, and the Ursus Court... haven't said a word.

During that time, we cannot lose comms for even a split second, unless we determine that we have to disconnect.   Continued use of Originium Arts will cause you discomfort, and if the nausea becomes unbearable, you are to immediately take the supplement I formulated for you.   Moderate dizziness is a side effect. It won't harm your nervous system, but it will massively drain your strength.   Be careful not to overdose. After the first ten minutes, you can take intermittent breaks. Do not overexert yourself.   We're asking a lot of you, Raidian.   Rosmontis, all of the enemy's messages will be sent to your portable terminal via Raidian. Feel them, and log them.   Should their location change, you cannot lose them. Seize their feelings and log them again.   Reach out with your body, Rosmontis, and picture yourself roaming the city.   Amiya...   You have your work cut out for you. If anything anomalous happens, I will stop your casting.

She needs to have the normal Infected respect her, have the Sarkaz mercenaries obey her, have the guerrillas trust her, have the zealots worship her...  She needs to have the distance between her and them clearly visible, and have these people able to examine each other.  According to a series of behavior exhibited by Reunion so far, we can very clearly realize that Reunion's other leaders do not particularly recognize Talulah's conduct at all.  Even Patriot, seeing through to her scheme, had no power to reverse the tide in the middle of its change. If he could have killed Talulah, all the same, he still would have been unable to alter Reunion tending towards collapse.  To say nothing of the plot to exploit the Infected that Talulah has drawn up inside her own head... The time she would need likely far exceed the time Reunion has existed so far.  I conjecture that all of Reunion's actions up to now have been premised on a plan. Namely...  'Reunion will perish after all this is over.'   Talulah will scatter keen, hidden forces across every part of her territory. When she needs them, she'll assemble them, and have them make their appearance at the right moment.  Doctor, I believe the Empire of Ursus's Third Army would not permit any Infected to act freely whatsoever.  However, Reunion's current conduct is all within the bounds of their tolerance. Superficial violence, lacking discipline and organization. The Third Army must be happy to see it.  Think about it carefully. Would they limit themselves to being onlookers? Thus, would they risk truly, willingly letting Talulah control a whole city\u2014even a whole country's state of affairs?  Or perhaps, even this is one of the weights on Talulah's scales, used to swindle the Ursus military out of their power... having them hibernate somewhere, waiting until the situation is just about to move on from her control.  And then, in the truest sense, she'll be able to use... the power she could never even touch. Just as she wishes.

A tyrant treasures one's own enablers, even if a tyrant more often than not recklessly destroys them for lack of foresight or composure, and weeps truest, deepest tears for it.  A conspirator does not. The tyrant has chess pieces, and the conspirator does too; but the tyrant is with them on the chessboard, while the conspirator sits outside of it.  We can suppose she has humanity, and thus might make mistakes.

Malice, or more precisely, all those chains of malice aren't going to disappear on their own.   Each destruction, each killing might only have been caused by a modicum of desire. In a lawless land, barbarism is simply left to breed rampantly on its own, and that is how it becomes the law of the land.   And this kind of law is much stronger than the law you'd find in the cities. It's simply indestructible.   That's violence. The violence that flows in our blood veins comes from the parts of us left untamed by civilization.    Listen.   Did you hear that...?   ...Singing...?   How peculiar.

{"character":"Kal'tsit","chunk":"  ......   There were two things that happened here that had to do with me.   The first of those happened some twenty years ago.   About twenty years ago, a small mining company controlled by the Boris Group of Ursus unearthed a strange set of equipment in the southern mountains.   News about this quickly traveled to the conglomerate's leader\u2014Count Boris.   At the time, the Count made a bold decision. He tried to build an industrial city with all the necessary facilities and equipment with the expectation that his conglomerate could shake its reliance on the military-controlled mining industry and the arms trade.   Now, the equipment could have been some inheritance passed down by the gods or a device of Sarkaz witchcraft. That doesn't matter. As long as it worked, it would give the Boris Group the breakthrough they needed.   Of course, it could also have been nothing but worthless scrap, and any amount of research would not have produced any meaningful results. It could also have been something perilous. Something that could level multiple settlements in the blink of an eye.   They put together a team of talented scientists. All of them were young, sick of working with elementary theories, embittered by society, in need of money, and had been marginalized by academia for years.","response":"\"protagonist\": No;\n\"antagonist\": No;\n\"extrovert\": No;\n\"introvert\": No;\n\"ally\/companion\": Yes;\n\"trickster\": No;\n\"shadow\": Yes;\n\"shapeshifter\": No;\n\"warrior\": No;\n\"sage\/wise one\": Yes","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":1.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":1.0}
{"character":"Kal'tsit","chunk":"  That's right.   Soon after I left Columbia, I found out about this through my own networks. I joined the group\u2014in order to keep them from blowing the entire city up.    I am something like an expert on the topic, so, one way or the other, I ended up becoming the scientists' mentors.   Now, Chernobog wasn't just your average emerging city. It used to be old and run down.   Before the scientists realized what the device's true purpose was, I allowed them to siphon a certain amount of its energy to provide Chernobog a resource other than Originium. Not much, but certainly not negligible.    Count Boris was beyond elated. He paid all that money, and he certainly got his money back.   He was someone who really knew how to do business.   Chernobog quickly developed, and droves after droves of people were drawn to the city, seeking opportunity.   Many smaller cities joined the Boris Group as well, either out of respect for Boris himself or because they were awed by how generous the man was with his money.   With Chernobog propelled to the fore, the scientists' research also reached an important breakthrough.   I... probably should've stopped them.","response":"\"protagonist\": Yes\n\"antagonist\": No\n\"extrovert\": No\n\"introvert\": No\n\"ally\/companion\": Yes\n\"trickster\": No\n\"shadow\": No\n\"shapeshifter\": No\n\"warrior\": No\n\"sage\/wise one\": Yes","protagonist":1.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":1.0}
{"character":"Kal'tsit","chunk":"  Let me continue.   Brilliant as they were, a few of my students uncovered the device's secrets on their own. First, they realized that the energy they were siphoning was generated only as a side effect of the device's operations. A kind of hibernation mode...   Its original purpose was for the device to keep functioning normally.   There was also one other thing that they realized. The energy that they had been siphoning for Chernobog was but a small fraction of the energy the device could actually provide. Just a tiny, tiny fraction.    At first, they were ecstatic.   This had to potential to greatly reduce Chernobog's reliance on the Originium mining industry.   If they could put together something similar to the device, then Ursus would never have to worry about energy again, and the mining and refining process of Originium would also become much simpler.   Then, fear began to sink in. If all that energy was used to forge weapons or begin a conquest, Ursus would undoubtedly be engulfed in a sea of flames yet again.    Now, fortunately, the scientists were all good, upstanding people. They wanted to prevent disaster.    And unfortunately... that didn't change a thing.   When the Fourth Army got involved, the scientists had already realized just how serious the whole situation was.   And by the time my students were ready to have the device sealed, the secret police had already figured out all of their weaknesses.   Ilia was a leader amongst the scientists. He was both righteous and stubborn, qualities that went hand in hand.   The secret police knew that kidnapping his family would only unleash the hatred in him, so they picked someone else.   Sergei, my oldest student.   He was Skullshatterer and Misha's father, a very indecisive chap.   The secret police hardly even threatened him, and that was enough to destroy what little determination he had.   The fear of losing his family and his respect for his colleague and their work tormented him, and in the end he chose what must have felt like a compromise to him.   He turned over the experiments' objectives and data to Count Boris.   The reality is he shouldn't have trusted anyone. A drowning man will clutch at a straw, yet that straw could also be the very thing that ends up killing him.    The Count didn't protect the scientists. He protected just Sergei and allowed the military to carry out an attack, which then turned into a massacre.    The Count didn't have the power to protect the scientists. He could barely even hold his head up in the presence of the military's top brass.   Even though the military and the nobility had lost much of their influence after the Great Rebellion, that didn't change the fact Count Boris's family was new money. They bought their noble status from another family.   Sergei managed to save his children, and the price he had to pay was to watch the murder of all of his colleagues in the Core City's sarcophagus.   After all the bodies were removed and the blood cleaned up, a new lab was set up for Sergei, built on top of his crumbling mentality.   Needless to say, Sergei never again produced anything meaningful with his research, and with the loss of all of their distinguished, albeit overly honest, scientists, Ursus's research on the device ended up in quite the mire.   After that, everyone simply forgot about the place. No one cared. Nothing could be changed.   After the secret police and the garrison packed their bags, the Count and Sergei had the placed sealed... The whole process was uneventful, too.   The equipment was kept running, and the energy just kept flowing from the sarcophagus to Chernobog's core city. Perhaps powering the entire city, even.   For Sergei's service and sacrifice, the Count nominated him to the position of the City Council secretary.   Oh, and this happened after Sergei's son, Alex, was found to be Infected and exiled.    The Count finally had the power to stand up against the military, and factories big and small began to spring up around his core city.   The Fourth Army no longer had him under their thumb. All they could do was watch Chernobog leave its circle of influence.   In the years since Chernobog began its operations, Count Boris also managed to make an enemy of Grand Duke Baikal, one of the advisors of the Third Army and the biggest beneficiary of the Farscope Refinery, thanks to their disputes over the prices of the raw materials used in manufacturing.   The Grand Duke ordered several clandestine attacks on the city, but none of the attempts were able to shake the city. It had already become one of Ursus's most important cities.   The Count then arranged matters so that the military was not allowed to garrison in Chernobog, so the armies could only do as the emperor told them, and stationed in the city's surroundings to defend it. To keep a watchful eye on the place, so to speak.   What's more, Chernobog is not bound by the military and the old nobility's rules. One after another, copycat cities began to emerge all around Ursus. The desire for minerals and products drove the masses to seek out better ways.    Instead of being mere slaves that reek of filth and blood, they wanted to become slaves of a higher purpose.","response":"Based on the provided dialogue, the character archetype for 'Kal'tsit' can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- Protagonist: No\n- Antagonist: No\n- Extrovert: No\n- Introvert: Yes\n- Ally\/Companion: Yes\n- Trickster: No\n- Shadow: No\n- Shapeshifter: No\n- Warrior: No\n- Sage\/Wise One: Yes\n\nKal'tsit exhibits traits of an introvert, as she is described as a character who is knowledgeable, observant, and reflective.

Have you ever wondered why all the Infected that Rhodes Island takes in are from the cities, are from well-off families, and had a decent education?   You have to admit. There are Infected out there who live in the wilderness, away from civilization; others live in far off places with no way to communicate with the cities; then there are those who live on the streets and in the back alleys, just trying to survive from one day to the next.   None of them have ever even heard of Rhodes Island.   To say nothing of those other Infected-oriented pharmaceutical and medical companies.   This is the reality we are in.   They didn't want to resort to violence. They just never had the chance to learn what else they could do.   In the past, many people worshipped the power of violence because of the violence others had inflicted on them. Violence worked on them, so they used it on those around them, and that worked on those other people as well.   Therefore, violence became their tool. They don't understand life without violence, and their lives will always be ruled by pain and hatred.    Violence isn't a plough. The road traveled by violence will always remain a barren land.

We stopped the core city, we got involved in the attack on Lungmen, and we know the entire conspiracy. That's enough to have them plotting to destroy us.   What would the Third Army do if Lungmen decided to strike at us?   They'd grab the popcorn.   The murderers in their fancy uniforms would watch our landship burn into a scorched hulk in the wastelands, one of the thorns in their side melting away.   And on the other side, a private company without registration in Lungmen, not under the protection of Lungmen, finds itself attacked and destroyed by unknown forces.   That doesn't sound like a problem for Lungmen or Yan, does it?   Unless, of course, we're holding Talulah.   Anyone who might want to strike at us first needs to consider the signal they're sending. Does it say to their rivals that they need Talulah? That she's key to this case?    That she grants an advantage, that she could eliminate a weakness?

But Kristen has chosen to leave all this to the coming generations. She's never considered this from the angle of benefit\u2014be it how she personally stands to gain, or how everyone does. Even the potential crises invited have gone ignored by her. Is there one more possibility, that Kristen, who lost her parents at a young age and grew up amid skepticism and derision, is out just to prove this one truth to people, and nothing more? This may well be what Saria thinks. As fellow students with Kristen in days past, as the very first supporter of her dreams...

Dr. {@nickname}, I've scanned your brain seven times over the past month or so, and the results are always the same. There's nothing wrong with your medial temporal lobe, and the neurons in other brain areas are as active as they are in most young people. Meaning you don't need to come to Medical for these unpleasant tests so often. There's no doubt that you've lost a lot of your memory. Even someone like you wouldn't be able to manipulate the results. Those memories are episodic, chiefly concerning the subjective awareness of your identity, and even more so about all your experiences before you fell asleep in the Chernobog sarcophagus. In contrast, your procedural memory has recovered extremely quickly. From my reports or Amiya's and Dobermann's observations, this conclusion is clear. Your ability to command, as exhibited during the Chernobog incident, is not significantly worse than before. There are many reasons for memory loss. Some are force majeure, others are subjective. Medical testing can only rule out qualitative pathological changes. Of course, you don't make as much noise as you used to. Considering your language center has not been damaged, I can only guess that the deprivation of episodic memory has caused some changes in your personality. To Rhodes Island, you are far more than just 'useful.' Even if you truly lost all your memories and become an ignorant bystander, Amiya would not have regretted saving you, and there will always be a place for you at Rhodes Island. In any case, I believe that the skills you possess will play just as key a role as they did in the past.","response":"(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": No); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": No); (\"sage\/wise one\": Yes)","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":1.0}

Those calculations for determining Rhodes Island's business efficiency, and even those scrawls that I can't make sense of. They are all evidence of your commitment to your duty. Although most of these tasks can be completed with the assistance of PRTS, I think this is your preferred method. As the density of your notes increases, your cognition also improves. PRTS is just a tool. Avoiding overreliance on tools is a good working habit. So that was a complaint? I would rather take those words as a compliment.

Besides... in Lungmen, you'll be safest under their protection.    If we don't act now, you'll be in grave peril.    Many of the Infected that were coming after you were already wearing Reunion's badge...    I'm sorry... But, that's really not our intention.

GreyThroat, the enemies movements are erratic.   The defenders will hold the line, while the casters cut down the enemy numbers. You and the snipers will take care of any Infected with Arts ability.   GreyThroat...   In principle, I can't allow anyone to harm the Infected.   Because, if I were to allow that, then wouldn't someone else allow the Infected to harm others? It's a vicious cycle.   But it's pointless. There's no room for the philosophy of ethics on the battlefield.   The ideal situation is that nobody hurts anybody. Regardless of their infection status.   Gavial is providing medical support so... Watch yourself out there. Don't get hurt.   What's that...? It looks like... Mephisto's herd...?   But... I can't sense any emotion from them?   No!   GreyThroat, get down! Something's wrong!

Attention all elite operators: this may be our first, last, and only large-scale battle in Lungmen.   Everyone take objective one as your primary mission.   My team and I will be focusing on engaging the enemy commander.   I want you all to remember: top priority is completing the terms of our contract, that is to work with the L. G. D. to ensure the security of Lungmen.   But Rhodes Island's mission in this battle is to reduce the friction between the Infected and uninfected people, to prevent clashes!   We are Rhodes Island! No matter what else we carry into battle!   No matter when, no matter where!   And of course, if at any point our operations fall outside our standards, we will put a stop to them at once!   As such, we go into battle with a heavy burden of responsibility on our shoulders.

Sorry, Doctor. I forgot you and Blaze would definitely go at it like this...   Why are you so pleased with yourself?    Anyway, all I need is your location and current operation.   You two seem to be getting along.   ...Really?   Keep at it.   Officer Ch'en, we're in position!   ...It's thanks to the L. G.

Did I just hear Miss Swire?   Of course. We have to solve everything ourselves.   It's not wishful thinking, Officer Ch'en. It's thinking about Misha, and the countless other Infected who died just like her.   It was the gap between those two worlds that killed them. Are we going to let that divide define us? Are we not going to fight to bridge it?   I hope you can understand, Officer Ch'en, why it is that the Infected and uninfected of Rhodes Island come together to fight for Lungmen.   They're here, Officer Ch'en.   GreyThroat?   If I recall correctly, he was the crossbowman with Mephisto, and one of Reunion's commanders.   ...You knew him?   Yeah.

That would be meaningless in the grand scheme of things.   Like now... like in this battle in front of us.   It wasn't one crossbow, one Art, one explosion, or one wound that causes all the death.   What we fight to defeat is the source of all of this... the hatred the uninfected have for the Infected, and vice versa, is the reason they kill each other.   We must tear up the soil that nurtures the hate. Using our pharmaceuticals, and our operations.   That was an Originium-boosted crossbow bolt.

Blaze is also gifted with a gregarious personality and savoir faire. As well as her own opinions.   If you want to lead her, if you want her support, you'll have to gain her trust.

{"character":"Amiya","chunk":"  Attention, our outstanding operators, I have some important information to report to everyone in Rhodes Island. This is Amiya.   As of last night, Rhodes Island has officially left Lungmen.   In light of recent developments, the trade agreement between us and Lungmen has been cancelled. We no longer have any reason or standing to remain inside the city.   Fortunately, we've already purchased a lot of supplies from Lungmen, which will sustain our operations for a while.   Unfortunately... Some of our operators will shortly be going deep into Chernobog's core city.   An extremely tough battle awaits us there.   ...Many may think that war is a distant concern to us.   War, they may say, is a conflict between two countries, and has nothing to do with a pharmaceutical company.   But war... I think war has never left us.\u00a0   We have always been in a war. The long war of injustice against the Infected, the war that drives people to hate one another.   To develop an effective treatment for Oripathy and give the Infected a chance to use it, our medics have poured countless hours into their research.   Likewise, it has always been our goal to provide the most advanced medical treatment to those here who suffer from Oripathy, inhibiting and slowing the progression of Oripathy.   But that is far from enough. Before we can achieve these goals, we must face the ever-growing conflicts between the Infected and uninfected.   The enemies of the Infected will not see them treated. And each crime they commit against the Infected aggravates the tensions between the groups.   All while others exploit and enslave the Infected for their own profit.   There are those who oppose us and even attack us, solely because we seek a cure for Oripathy... We have suffered this in the past.   Imagine... Imagine if we develop a medicine to treat this disease, but never have a chance to administer it to the Infected. What then?   Our enemy is not only 'Oripathy.' There is no safety for us standing back from this war anymore.   Two weeks ago, Reunion and Rhodes Island engaged in a violent confrontation. Many of our operators sacrificed themselves in Chernobog.   ...a story we have seen unfold far too many times.   But if every sacrifice demands vengeance from us, then we will be locked into an endless cycle of revenge. Countless lives... will be taken.   Taken by our enemies, and taken by our own hands.   Our struggle with Reunion cannot rest upon hatred. If we are able to negotiate with them, we will demand from them an explanation, and hold them accountable for their actions.   But Reunion is still gripped by their madness, even today. They have taken control of Chernobog's core city, and are driving it into Lungmen.   Even stranger, Ursus has not surrendered its territorial control of the core city.   They retain a territorial claim on Chernobog, even with it under Reunion's control, even when Ursus never...                                                         Even when Ursus never took action as this entire incident unfolded. The Empire of Ursus ignored the atrocities committed in Chernobog, and made no effort to stop them whatsoever.   ...They abandoned their own citizens.   This has led me to conclude that Ursus has conspired to bring about these events. A collision with the core city will spark an international war. A war between Ursus and Yan\u2014\u2014   By then, it will be too late.   No matter who stands behind Reunion, no matter how hard they've pushed, no matter who the real mastermind behind all this is: there will be only one truth laid grimly at our feet.   \u2014\u2014'The Infected caused this war.'   No matter the outcome of the war, the Infected will always be the scapegoat.   They will face even more brutal oppression, more miserable lives, and... an eternal, fiery hatred.   If that comes to pass, all Rhodes Island has done will come to nothing. There won't be a single country in the world that will allow us to treat the Infected, or allow them a normal life.   Indeed... this is an unavoidable part of our protracted war on Oripathy.   Rhodes Island has always been fighting this war. And it's a difficult war to win.   But despite that, we will never give up.   We will fight the fanatics with reason, and enmity with clever strategy. We will press on, because no one wants to see a bitter end to our efforts.   So we will stop Reunion. We will stop the Chernobog core city from colliding with Lungmen.   I hope those of you staying here on the landship will look after Rhodes Island. Whether or not we return, Rhodes Island will fight on.   Right. Situation normal.

Rosmontis, I promise you this.    I promise I will come back alive.

The whole point of the Core City infiltration was to save lives too.  Don't ever say things like, 'There are causes worth giving your life for.' Never say that.  Life is precious, and more importantly, your life belongs to yourself.  No one... absolutely no one can let their life go to waste for us.  ...There's no such thing as necessary sacrifices.

If we aren't in a position to help someone, we must create the position.   I'm just a little frustrated.   Medicine is for pain, to heal wounds. And some medicines can heal. But in any case, they can't erase the pain and suffering endured before the medicine is applied.

The troops here managed to take over the city, probably thanks to corruption or some equally dirty work... As for the original residents... probably either enslaved or driven out.   They didn't stand a chance against us, at the very least.   Just relatively speaking. Compared to the regular Ursus Army, at least.

We have all the resources we need to survive now.    We really needed these supplies. Without them, we won't make it through the winter.

{"character":"Muelsyse","chunk":"Alright. My turn to ask, then\u2014 As far as I know, Anthony's accomplices in the jailbreak included the prison's original mortician, Ms. Domma, but also a woman by the name of Robin. What bugs me about that is, by my intel, Robin should've been one of the assassins sent to take Anthony out. But going by your version of the events, you seem to have just one helper, and that's Ms. Kafka. Could it be Robin wasn't your doing? I said that already. Whuh? Wait, you're not telling me you only got Anthony?! He's your only lead?! ...And then you managed to bump straight into the whole assassination. Oh, the pieces are fitting... This makes so much actual sense. But... are you sure you should've told me about this? If you'd kept me going like you were gonna stop the assassination, I'd have been way more impressed, you know. I see. At first, I thought we were alike, but looking at it now, it's Ms. Mayer. That's who you're like. You're the same sort of person. But you have the research you love, and you don't care about much else. So there's gotta be some reason you were forced to care about this. And that reason, I'm guessing, is the 'Di\u03b1bolic Crisis,' right? Sorry, sorry. Should've kept my mouth shut. It's okay, I've only heard things about it. I don't even know what happened.

{"character":"Muelsyse","chunk":"Well. That goes to show you don't have a full grasp on Energy's MO. Anthony's a hidden danger. Imagine some entity that can't allow any hidden danger or uncontrollable elements. Imagine they find out they've left a little loose end... That's the end of the Bros. So they've spent a couple years weaving this hit together. Making it real. Burying an imprisoned Anthony six feet under. But there are some things that can't be walked back, huh? Back to the assassin, by the way. If that woman, Robin, wasn't backed by you, then that only leaves one possibility. Robin's an assassin who went turncoat midway. Right? So, could I trouble you to switch angles? I'm a little curious about this assassin lady and her prisonly actions. Given she and Anthony escaped together, I'm sure you've verified her status and experiences yourself? Robin's not a professional assassin? Looks like the material I had on her was correct. She really was a security worker. Her skills certainly should've invited trust. But this all smacks of a little weirdness to me... Why they hire her is my question... but that's not too important. Skip it for now. More importantly, it seems most of the assassins were like Robin in that they'd been hired solo. They had no idea if they had any competition, and no clue who their employer was. Your guess is as good as mine. But just like I said before, the Bros paid big to get rid of Anthony. Money with their blood and sweat in it.

{"character":"Muelsyse","chunk":"Isn't the answer pretty obvious, though? The idea is the prison gets used as a lockbox to shove every 'troublesome' person. And it's the people none of the cities want to bother with. Getting inside isn't the tough part. Ms. Kafka never told you how exactly she got in there, am I right? Of course, the prison is still a prison. Getting out is tough. Like I said, it only visits cities on the edge once every few months. The rest of the time, it stops in the barrens. A convict escapes out there, they're stuck in the endless barrens until they die. Here's the thing. Robin mentioned it. A mysterious person promised it. There was a way to get them out for sure. So as long as they didn't slip up and get themselves killed in there, AND successfully ran the hit on Anthony, then they'd just need to wait for extraction. Of course not. Which is why I said none of them knew about the others. And once they were inside, even if they figured it out, there'd be no escape. Their only option would be to kill Anthony or die trying. It's a simple, effective method. Oh. Do I actually have to start from there? Alright, Ms. Silence, now I know you really didn't care much about this in the past. Buuut, maybe you pulled something so bold and brash\u2014and succeeded\u2014precisely because you didn't realize. Sorry, sorry, I'm not making fun of you here.

Whoo, from the way you reacted to this prison's history just now, I'm gonna need to give you a walkthrough of this side from the top, Ms. Silence. Do you still remember Kafka recalling the prison's Superintendent Barton? What did he say? Pilot. Special approval. You know what that implies? It implies business. In Columbia, the most profitable business is wherever the power is. This prison's a model case. I'm telling you this prison is in fact Warden Randal's money machine. Sure is. A heavily guarded prison. Send whoever you don't like in there for a fate worse than death. Send whoever you wanna safeguard in there to be protected.

{"character":"Muelsyse","chunk":"Your query's totally reasonable, but truth is I don't have a clear-cut answer either. But we can work backwards\u2014in conclusion, they didn't do that. And surely they tried it before. So the only possible answer is they failed. Personally, I think it's because the warden didn't want to get himself stuck between a rock and a hard place. Or perhaps Anthony's mistreatment could be bought, but Anthony also had a massive influence in the prison. If he died, you sure couldn't handle it like a typical prisoner death. A lot of people'd love Randal's position, and as far as I know, he's got major guile too. I don't think he'd take the risk. Someone like him? It's more likely he took HydeBro's money and just did nothing. Hmm. Yeah, that's possible as well. Ol' Smith used to be a fair household name in Bunkerhill City. Sending his son to prison for his protection wouldn't surprise me one bit. I've already answered it, Ms. Silence. You're smart. You just don't want to believe it. What I mean is they couldn't do it in Mansfield State Prison, but that doesn't mean they couldn't do it in Bunkerhill City Prison. Looks like you finally understand, Ms. Silence. You said that HydeBro never touched Anthony's family. That's a faulty assumption. The only reason they're not dead is because they don't need to be. Maybe you just can't comprehend it, but in Columbia, death's far from the worst thing that could happen to a person. Moreover, after dealing with Simon Co., HydeBro had no competitors left.

HydeBro had a grip over their local lockup, but none at all on the prison a couple states over, Mansfield State Prison. Well? What in the world, indeed? We finished Robin's past and what she was doing in the prison. Wow, so this is when the two of them cross paths? Let me guessy-guess. Robin's thing about entering C-Zone for cleaning. It's that, right? I imagine she heard it was the safest way to meet Anthony. Ahah. Now that's straight to the punch. I like it~ Mmm... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued. I feel like I'd hear some pretty interesting things. But let's stick to the jailbreak itself first. I'll keep wiiiith Robin's. Sounds like she was pretty amply prepared.

Let's say we have a line. Saria's line. Rhine Lab's always done things above board. They've come close to crossing the line, but they've never actually done it, so Saria never said anything. But that whole string of events, the 'Di\u03b1bolic Crisis' included, meant that someone was trying to cross that line. They might even have crossed it already. Saria wouldn't have that.

And well, setting aside the question of whether Anthony would willingly subject himself to Saria's grumpiness, Saria probably wanted to keep Anthony on her leash. But even if Anthony's okay with it, Saria probably thinks he's nothing but trouble. That's why she chose to have him join you guys at Rhodes Island. It's a pretty good choice. Actually, she probably thinks that it's all good enough for her as long as Anthony makes it out of the prison alive and things don't go either my way or Ferdinand's.

I think if I were Rhodes Island's leader, I wouldn't mind taking in Anthony at all. Well, to put it simply, Saria snatched away something I was hoping she would give me. But she didn't keep it for herself. She pawned it to a pretty well-guarded shop. Bingo~ If Saria decided to keep Anthony around, I guess there wasn't anything I could've done about it for the time being. But since she chose to turn him over to Rhodes Island, there's still room for me to intervene. Don't worry, I'm not asking you to do this all by yourself. If Saria, the former Defense Director, was able to form a partnership with Rhodes Island, then I'm sure they'll be willing to work with me, the Ecological Director, too.

We can slap a fancy label on everything to make them seem less ugly on the outside, but that doesn't actually make them any more beautiful. Let me give you an example.

It is the cleanest place in Trimounts. This is the one place in Trimounts where I feel at ease. Oftentimes, I choose to operate through a clone not because I want to. But because I have to. I grew up in an orphanage in Trenton, near Trimounts. The headmaster said I was found on the doorsteps of the orphanage. No one knows who my parents are. I realized at an early age that I was different. My powers are unique, but they are not Originium Arts. I'm much more sensitive to Originium than most people; even a slight increase in Originium concentration is enough to affect my health. What am I? No one knows. That's why I've searched for the answer since I was little. Ironically, it's also the reason why my grades have always been good. Finally, I found that word hidden away in some ancient books. The word is not unknown to you... you do have many secrets, don't you, Doctor? Well, it's not important. Anyway, I tracked down my biological parents' old Trimounts home, but the house had long since changed hands. I followed the trail they left behind, and eventually found where they went. It's this village right here... so remote I thought I made a mistake. Most of the buildings have fallen into ruin, they look to be centuries-old. I didn't see anyone.

They lived cautiously but bravely, looking for ways to survive in civilization without coming into contact with Originium. They knew Originium would kill them, someday. They accepted it. They contracted Oripathy. Elves are highly sensitive to Originium and lack resistance to Oripathy symptoms. Few live more than a month after contracting Oripathy.

{"character":"Silence","chunk":"Fine. If we're going to talk about it, we might as well start from the beginning. First, let's take a look at the prison's design. The architects clearly learned from their experience with the nomadic cities. The prison wasn't built directly on top of the chassis. They built a mountain base first, like what you'd find in the real world, and then they finished the prison design on top of that. This is a pretty common technique these days, but, back in the day, it was ahead of its time, and it was very successful. Now, let's set aside the prison's outside appearance for the time being. The prison has three floors, and each floor's structure is more or less the same. At the lower-left of each floor is the A-Zone. This is where the non-Infected are kept. To the upper-right is the B-Zone, the Infected block. The upper-left and lower-right corners are where the guardhouses are. That's where the jailers usually stay. The black monolith in the center is the C-Zone, where the most serious felons are kept. The area in the middle here is the underground factory. This is where the prisoners work together. Over here is the clinic. It's also Domma's room. Next to that is the morgue. On the other side is the library that they built at Anthony's suggestion. That's more or less the prison's layout. Mina spent a bit of time exploring, and with the basic idea figured out, they came up with a way to escape from the prison. You can tell by looking at the layout that the C-Zone tower isn't actually built directly onto the ground. There is an elevator in the middle that goes to the basement. Not only that, but the tower itself can actually be lowered underground.","response":"(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": No); (\"introvert\": Yes); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": No); (\"sage\/wise one\": Yes)","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":1.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":1.0}
{"character":"Silence","chunk":"Right, and to lower the tower, you normally need to flip the switches in two of the guardhouses at the same time. First off, they didn't go to the guardhouses. They thought about it at one point. However, they found out the mechanisms could only lower the tower very slowly. Anthony figured that out from a document he found in the library. The document was probably a design diagram left behind after the prison's construction. My assumption is no one thought about it, so they stuck it in there when Anthony suggested building a library. It was twenty-five years ago. In any case, they couldn't just wait for the tower to slowly sink to the bottom. The guards would have tried to do something, and so they abandoned this idea altogether. Fortunately, they found something else on the document\u2014 Take a look at the top of the central tower. There's a room here, and it isn't a prison cell. That's the real control room of the tower, if not the whole prison. That's right, and it's also possible to cut off the prison's electricity there to cause a commotion, however brief. There usually isn't anyone on that floor. You need a special elevator key to get inside. The regular keycards that the jailers carry can't access this floor. There is. Domma provided that way out. She said that, going by her memory, the last morgue doctor had told her there weren't any previous designs the architects could reference when building the prison, and there were actually a few abandoned structures at the bottom of the mountain. And some of those led to the surface outside the prison. In particular, there was one fairly close to the morgue.","response":"Based on the provided dialogue, let's analyze the character archetype for 'Silence':\n\n- Protagonist: No\n- Antagonist: No\n- Extrovert: No\n- Introvert: Yes\n- Ally\/Companion: No\n- Trickster: No\n- Shadow: No\n- Shapeshifter: No\n- Warrior: No\n- Sage\/Wise One: Yes\n\nSilence in this context seems to exhibit traits of an introvert and a sage\/wise one.

Once you find a weaker section of wall and breach it, you don't need any advanced tools to dig the tunnel. That's what they did, they took turns digging at the clinic. Have you forgotten already? Getting to the surface outside the prison isn't going to do you much good when the prison isn't stopped at a city. The prison also raises its security whenever it stops at a city. When that happens, the prisoners get much less free time. Even Anthony hardly had any free time. They couldn't just have gone to the clinic like before. Right, since the prison was stopped at a city, Mina left with the construction crew before the jailbreak, so she didn't actually participate in it. She rendezvoused with the gang outside the prison. Anyway, at some point in the last month and a half, they stole the key that gave them access to the control room at the top of the tower from Chief Barton. Then, a few days before the prison was slated to make its next port call, they finished digging the tunnel and made sure it led them to the surface. Now all the preparations were finally complete. We're almost to the end. That's right. In the end, they decided they would escape during cleaning duty at C-Zone, while the prison is docked at Nulaiteburgh.

She's completely cut ties with Rhine Lab. She's a Rhodes Island operator right now. The way I see it, she had no reason to get involved.

But that's all you know, and from all indications, it seems you really don't know that much about how everything unfolded there. And considering how Saria showed up out of nowhere... The only conclusion I can draw is\u2014 She was working with you, but she turned her back on your agreement. No, and I really didn't understand why until just now either. Kafka certainly didn't stand a chance against her, so in theory she should've been the true victor of this whole incident. And well...

But nobody thinks it's anything special, because people here die from lots of things.   Everyone looks after Oripathy patients like they're just regular sick people. All they know about the disease is you can catch it in the mines.   So very few people go into the mines. It's been that way for a long time.   Yeah.

I'd rather you let me put myself in danger than take away my freedom to do anything.   Doctor, don't you think this is funny?   I think it's funny. Only after I left the tribe did I realize what kind of hatred people have for Oripathy sufferers.   It took me a long time to figure that out.

Short version is I'm here to look for you.   That too. But there's another reason I'm looking for you.   Do you have your people mining ore?   ...Tch.   No, your Big Ugly Whatever is great. I'm totally fine with that.   But if you're putting your people at risk of Oripathy infection for the sake of some ore, then as a doctor I have no choice but to stop you.   Huh?   But your people are getting infected!   Huh? Why didn't you say so earlier?!   That's pretty important...!   Agh, fine.   Doctor, did I really not ask?!   Agh, Doctor, take my side here!   Hey, why are you taking your clothes off?   Huh? Your body...   ......   All right then.   My mistake. Sorry for accusing you, Zumama.   Then let's talk about the other thing.

Doctor, Tomimi should be in her general studies class now. You check on her when you're done.   Hm?   Haha.  Hey, Zumama.  Who do you think you're talking to? Not just the Infected. Mine security, the villagers nearby, and that old man from Rim Billiton. I took care of all of them.  Yeah, I've got a problem with the way he treats the Infected.

Yes, yes, I can hear you hiss. Worry not! This will be among the most entertaining matches you've seen, and I put my career and reputation on the line to say that!   You are bound to start cheering the moment you hear their names! You have my word!   First, on this side, we have the youngest son of the Ingra family, Olmer Ingra!   That's right. He's the one who been taken to court countless times for crippling anyone who dares cross him, and thanks to the coffers of his countless sponsors has been ruled innocent over and over by the National Council! 'Brassrust' Ingra!   The Butcher of the Field from the Bloodboil Knightclub! The ruthless knight who has never allowed even a single opponent to step out of the ring in one piece!   He will beat his armor, his rage, and his mercilessness into the heart of each and every one of his opponents! And most likely their skulls, too!   And on the other side! The other side\u2014   Oh, ooh! One of the oldest knight families, Nearl! Let us say their name out loud! Nearl!   The hero of Kazimierz who outsmarted the Leithanians all by himself, the Tenebrous Knight who assassinated the king's traitorous retinue, and, last but not least, the Radiant Knight, the embodiment of shame who was exiled for getting infected!   All of them came from this family!   What's that? Not up for a history lesson? Fine! Well then, who managed to defeat the Roar K.C.'s vanguard, Szewczyk, before she even got her own title?   Who's the Roar Arena most popular knight of the month?!   Will all this change because of this one match? Will 'Brassrust' bash in this pretty little face of hers?   Let us welcome\u2014Maria Nearl\u2014!   What will be the outcome of this battle? Who will reign victorious? Pick up the terminals next to your seats and start voting!   You know the rules! Your monetary support won't influence the match's outcome, but it will directly influence whether your wallet's empty or brimming with cash!","response":"(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": Yes); (\"extrovert\": Yes); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": No); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": Yes); (\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":1.0,"extrovert":1.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":0.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":1.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}
{"character":"Greatmouth Mob","chunk":"Ingra! He's chasing her like a storm!   This is the most destructive match the Roar Arena has seen this event\u2014! The Butcher of the Field! 'Brassrust' Ingra!   Just last month, at the season's first event, poor 'Foehn' got absolutely decimated when the 'Brassrust' kept pummeling him until all of his limbs were crushed!   You heard that right! He pummeled with his bare hands! That's definitely not the kind of thing you'd expect a knight carrying a giant axe to do!   All eyes are on Maria Nearl here at the Roar Arena today, but is this also where we see her meet a bloody fate? Let us know what you in the audience think!   Just like that! 'Brassrust' Ingra!

There's an enormous difference in both size and power!   I can't emphasize this enough\u2014! Commission's half off! Isn't this act of courage worth a few dozen gold coins?!   Wait. It's you.

You said how you were all for young against old, and how you didn't even want to take this job, but you've got other ideas too, don't you?   Easy enough.   We're just in luck. The better the skills, the easier they take the bait.   But what's important is, as a Rim Billitonian, how she chased her way into Shangshu. And who it is controlling her behind the scenes.   I didn't hurry too fast from Lungmen to Shangshu. If she really was out tracking me down, she could've pulled things off at any Messenger station. Why wait to move until I'm on the Liang estate?   Not to mention, a Rim Billitonian wantonly raiding a Yan magistrate? Either she's an idiot, or someone's using her.   Not necessarily. People do act naive at times.   When they want something from someone very badly.   You're imagining things.   We have a level of trust.   Good people always know each other well.   ......   If I start telling a youngster like you, Miss Du, it'll be your fault when you get bored.   You've got the wrong idea there. I run a licensed detective agency.

If I suddenly lost something I was real used to and felt was real nice, I'd be struggling for sure. Not to mention after losing it, I'd have to make do with junk instead. Sometimes, people's wills just bend like paper, and what Bol\u00edvar's like now really doesn't help. If you told me this place was full of people with firm wills, I wouldn't believe you. It can't have been that smooth as first, but as time went on, nobody could stand up to reject it all. All of this has become some sort of status quo. But I'll also acknowledge, for being able to decide straight from the start that this was how this city would come to manifest, this Mayor really is phenomenally powerful. Powerful to the point that it's frightening. Come to mention it, Missy, does this MC seem familiar to you? Mmm. I feel like I've seen her somewhere, too. D.D.D.? Oh, now I remember. She's that real famous DJ, right? I saw a poster once. What's she doing here as a presenter, huh. Mm? Wait... Sideroca? What are you doing here? Out on a mission? No, we came for a different reason.

In those manga about master swordsmen, her sort would be the main character.

To my understand, Rhodes Island has some special expertise in countering Reunion?    Oh...?    I've been told that Rhodes Island was involved with the Chernobog incident, and managed to obtain a lot of intel about Reunion.    It is Lungmen that will decide whether or not we will exchange information. If Rhodes Island cannot even provide us with this level of information...    Hah.

Madam Ch'en, based upon your best information, how would you assess Rhodes Island's combat abilities?    And your assessment?    When it comes to fighting crime and prevent infiltration, the L.G.D. is more than sufficient.    Rhodes Island may be able to bring more to the table. However...    Of the things that Rhodes Island has requested, there is one 'item' that we are unwilling to exchange based upon what has been offered.    The temporary defense cooperation that you're providing is far from equal value. As things stand, your 'asking price' is a bit too high.

First, Rhodes Island will help the L.G.D. suppress the Reunion threat. This includes identifying threats within Lungmen as well as those related to fallout from Chernobog.    This also includes assessing the degree that the Infected have infiltrated Lungmen. I expect that you will share any potentially helpful information with us.

The fact that Yan has not waged war for centuries does not mean they lack the capacity to fight.

And in the countless settlements that dot the land, I have never yet found one where the descendants knew the location of the graves of their ancestors.

Lin was laughing... laughing like we didn't have blood on our hands... laughing like we were boys in the time of our lives.   Edward was the scion of the highest Londinium nobility. And we were keeping that secret in Lungmen. But Kashchey already knew, he may have long since started plotting.     He told my jealous twin and the Shadow of Londinium about Edward and my sister... about their relationship...   I was forced to choose between Edward or my sister's unborn child.   I hid it for ten years after Edward died. Only my brother and Kashchey knew. But now, Edward and my sister are both gone from this world.

There's no telling when we'll meet again. Take care, Grandmaster. I will. By the way, you said something about Ch'en's swordsmanship yesterday. 'Skillful, but not yet the peak of perfection.' Ch'en has talent, but she only just started learning the Chi Xiao style recently. She has not mastered its true essence.

{"character":"FrostNova","chunk":"  Ugh....   I was born in a mine in the northwest tundra.   The mine was small and remote, not part of any city, and there are with no settlements around. There was nothing to see but snow all year round.   This mine was hell, built only to spread death and slavery. There are countless such mines in the snowy plains.   My birth parents were miners in that hellish pit.   My grandmother stayed with me through my early years of learning to speak, but she never told me what crimes my parents committed to be sentenced to mine labor.   Later, when I was a little older, I asked around in the mines and learned that both of my parents had opposed the Emperor's wartime plans.   Their arrest was also an accident. The bottom two lines of the arrest warrant were blank, so the sergeant in charge of the search haphazardly copied the name on the door plate.   Without trial, my parents lost their names and moved from their warm little town to the cold Northlands to serve a centuries-long sentence.   Of course, no one would even live to see that, let alone ever leave alive.   My grandmother was sentenced to the mines together as a 'harborer' of criminals, and moved with them.   In fact, all the miners there had very similar experiences.   Naturally, both of my parents contracted Oripathy down there. All the miners did.   Now, even if you escaped this mine, no one would believe a word you said. You're just an Infected person, the most horrible, vicious and extreme of the Oripathy patients.   However, the overseer of the mine, a certain Ursus military garrison, believed that the natural death rate of the Infected was still too slow.   They drew straws to decide the fates of the Oripathy sufferers, killing them for fun and sport.   Maybe it was the miners that drove them crazy, rather than the snow. And maybe the Infected didn't count as human in their eyes.   When I was five, my parents drew the black lot.   When I was ten, my grandmother drew the black lot.   When I was eleven, I drew the black lot myself, but it didn't matter, they didn't care about the lottery anymore. They just want to abandon the whole mine.   By that time, all the adult Infected in the mines had died out, and the Emperor's new policies had left the mines starved of people.   Under orders, the Ursus overseers prepared to go ahead and execute the last of the Infected.... A few sick children.   Afterwards they would collapse the mines to serve as mass graves for the infected, to cover up their sins.   I learned later, in my travels, that they do this all the time.   I was sad. I was in pain.   I had broken a lot of ore. I lived with other kids in the mines, we loved each other, and we were all going to die for nothing.   Strong feelings hatched in my chest, the deaths of both my parents and my grandmother played vividly in my mind.   When the execution started, my Arts erupted from within me, killing the four soldiers carrying out the execution..   Of course, I didn't have the power to turn things around.   The children were mere cattle to the overseers, who, as soldiers, carried sharp blades and wore solid armor, and we were like bugs who just managed to sting them.   The cries of my siblings reached my ears just as they knocked me to the ground and the final wave of slaughter was about to begin...   A guerrilla band arrived.   That was Buldrokkas'tee's team.

He didn't want to drag his son down with him, only to die in some dark corner of the world with the disease.   However, during the 'Great Rebellion', his son was campaigning for the rights of the Infected. Long out of touch with his father, the son still sees him as an Ursus puppet.   And he was. They commanded him to keep order in his own ranks at all costs. He allowed the soldiers to use their weapons, conflict erupted, and corpses piled in the snow drifts.   That's who he was.

If you look so peaceful in the face of death, then I think maybe you really have no attachments at all.   Interesting. You are not scared?   I guess those who do not fear death have little love left for the world.   A question I think about all the time....   'Am I afraid of death?'   I've heard that the Ursus garrisons call me the Yeti Princess, the Wintry Death....   The truth is, we were just a few ragtag squads wandering the tundra, barely scraping by.   My Arts were powerful, I proved as much to my enemies and teammates alike.   Of course, my body, as you can see, is only that of an Oripathy sufferer.   I felt special, not because of my illness, but because of the feelings my frost instilled in me.   I saw my ability as a blessing, but Buldrokkas'tee, that grumpy old fart, treated it like a curse.   I couldn't feel the cold as we waded through the deep mud in the swamp, icy water soaking my legs.   The old man wouldn't let go into battle, even as his soldiers took heavy casualties.   He lit his oil lamp and sat quietly at the table by himself. I think he was crying, but I couldn't be sure, and I didn't know if I should comfort him.   In my fifth year, I summoned a cold stream for the first time in the face of the enemy.   One soldier was frozen into a block of ice, another accidentally fell on the block and they both shattered into pieces.   I joined the fight, the soldiers looked at me in awe, my brothers and sisters were proud of me, and other infected said\u2014\u2014   'That's our big sister. She saved all our lives.'   Did my Arts actually save anyone?   The children from the mine carried the Originium crystals I had made, and we became the 'Yeti Squad'.   Those crystals radiate my cold, and we bring frost and vengeance to the enemies of the Infected.   But that's really... just cold. The cold of winter that won't birth new life.   Even so, I feel very lucky. For my brothers and sisters could survive.   We could live in this world.","response":"(\"protagonist\": Yes); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": No); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": Yes); (\"sage\/wise one\": Yes)","protagonist":1.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":1.0,"sage_wise_one":1.0}

Imagine it: we met in the ruins of an old city that had become a battlefield. She was alone, carrying nothing but her roster and a book of ledgers.   Even the things she said I found impractical to the point of ridiculousness.   But she said to us, 'Come with me.'   She fought with us, and with her strength and ideals, she became our friend. Together we left the snowy plains and headed for the cities of Ursus.   Whether was the words she spat out after pausing to think, or the swing of her great sword as she slashed alongside me, her power was real, and plenty impressive.   When the wounded needed treatment, she was there. When discussing strategy and philosophy with the Infected, she was there. And when fighting against the Ursus death squads, she was also there.   ...We even get to dine with some regular people. She didn't care. There was nothing in her eyes but the purest authenticity.   Our team grew and so did our friendships. The people brought in were good at fighting, and they were good people.   At the time, I considered her my friend. She quietly helped me make these candies, even though she was terrible at it and they tasted worse.   She made a funny face as she ate them. Then she'd force a smile at me.   It was really something. She worked so hard to put on a brave face. It made me laugh.   Everything's different now.   Chernobog was destroyed by a Catastrophe, as you can well see. All the normal people here died or became newly Infected.   Their eyes were dead. No desire to live anymore whatsoever.   If this is what she wanted, then we never should have followed her.   And in case you didn't know, here's a secret....   She's planning to take over Lungmen. She says it won't be like Chernobog, and that the Infected will get their own city instead of a giant ruin like this place.   Would you trust someone like that?   If she's acting, then she's the greatest actress the world has ever seen.   But there's a thought stuck in my head.   'What are my chances of winning if I went up against her?'   Once we part ways, once I find out she's been lying to the Infected, or that she's been plotting against them...   I will fight her. She must know the price of betrayal.   My countless deadly battles with Ursus have cleansed my mind and honed my skills.   I say with the utmost conviction: even if I cannot defeat her, I can let death take her from the world along with me.   The stubborn old man wouldn't agree with me.

That summer, a few men from the cities came to our town, led by a fine, magnificent lady. She said I was the one they sought. I was just thirteen at the time. They brought me to Kou-wu to a martial arts school, the Liens, and she was its master. That's how I met my master, and all there was to it. I had room and board, and when I had the time, I could help out at construction sites and earn some coin to send to my family back home. I remained diligent over the past ten years, but never once did I think my master did me a favor for taking me in. I made it a point to rely on none but myself. I would rather go without a meal than be looked down upon by my master. But... she was getting on in years. I once thought her formidable, matchless, even. But she was seriously ill. Couldn't even get a decent night's sleep. That was when I came to realize I could stay there no longer. All my fellow disciples had left, and it was my time to do so as well. But... last year, I killed someone by accident. Someone whom I should not have killed. I thought it was a friendly match between dojos. It wasn't until much later that I found out the man had sold his life. He was meant to die by my hands. The Lien style's reputation was already on its last legs, but they wanted to defame our name nonetheless. It was all a ploy to bring my master to swallow her pride and get her down on her knees. \u2014And then\u2014 My master, her hair white as ash and braided just like my mother's, stood before all and spilled her own blood as the rules dictated!","response":"(\"protagonist\": Yes); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": No); (\"introvert\": Yes); (\"ally\/companion\": No); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": Yes); (\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":1.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":1.0,"ally_companion":0.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":1.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}

{"character":"Nian","chunk":"A long time ago, there existed many gods in the lands of Yan. The Yan emperor at the time saw his territory prosper, but his people suffered disasters and misfortunes one after another. He lamented this vicious cycle, and spent a long time to come up with a solution. He was the True Lung. Likely one of the most controversial men in Yan history, he was at the time still young in years, and his passion was unrivaled. As the emperor of Yan, he turned to his trusted retinue and told them this\u2014 All the lands under heaven belong to the throne, and all men are my servants. Why then do the divinities above listen not to the will of the people of Great Yan and deprive our lands of their protection? ...As you probably know, when the 'gods' are brought up in certain countries' folklore or history, they aren't necessarily merely philosophical concepts. That said, they aren't exactly all that mighty and revered either. Case in point, the Lung found one such god deep in the mountains. A prideful and disdainful god. Yan's long history was a brief stretch of time to him... Naturally, he didn't give any thought to the Lung's opinions, and he had no reason to care about the lives of mere mortals. Now, this is where the problem lies. The Lung was too concerned with his subjects and his country. He issued and personally led his entire military, joined by many a formidable fighter, to take to the mountains on this wild hunt\u2014 And... beyond anyone's expectations, being that the Lung first uncovered there decided to betray his kin and his fellow deities. It divided up its own strength, and participated in this once-in-a-lifetime wild hunt. After this great wild hunt, Yan slayed several of these 'gods' who dared to stand up against the Lung, and all those unwilling to submit to his rule were exiled. Much blood was shed, and many lives were lost. Yan paid a dear price, and that's how this controversy surrounding the True Lung came to be. But he personally didn't care about this, and his campaign continued for as long as the Lung lived. When he was finally old and frail, he found the last such being remaining in Yan's lands. The most ancient and the most sacred. The eternal being that chose to betray its kin for the Lung's cause. The traitor had already received the justice it deserved. When its kin left the lands of Yan, they also took care to put out its flames of arrogance. Thus, its true nature was laid bare to the emperor\u2014 Anyway, its contributions had more than earned it the Lung's mercy. Nonetheless, the Lung forced it to serve Yan. To serve heaven, the lands, and its people to keep the world at peace. Ever since, the fortunes of Yan have always belonged to the True Lung and his subjects. And at the same time, the so-called 'gods'\u2014Though they had existed long before all the nations in the world came to be, they chose to hide themselves. They spread their own seeds across the land, placed the broken shards of their power and souls, and let them take root in this world in their place.

I can make commitments and decisions, accordingly, to your proposals. Conflict has been far from my intent up to now. As the head, I will not put up with any losses either. But if it's for putting this grievous state of affairs in check, for the alliance of the three clans of the snow mountains, then in the capacity of Kjeragandr's people, the Silverashes can make concessions. \u2014I am fully able to offer the valleys and mines, with both hands.

So as to avert conflict between the three clans, Kjerag ought to have a leader who can hold the faith of both the three clans, and the Snow Realm's citizens, at once.

If the three clans could act together, then regardless of any difference in earnings\u2014 A country's stance upon foreign trade versus a company's stance upon foreign trade are completely divorced concepts, and the results obtained will be a world apart.

In earlier times, before nomadic cities were invented, when men were sent scrambling across the world by Catastrophes, the different cultures that had been broken up all across the lands knew little about one another. Modern nations had yet to be established, and there were no communications or contact between them. Then, the age of innovation came two hundred years ago. It was still a time when everyone focused only on their own development, rarely making contact with one another. However, fast forward to a few decades ago, the nations in the world gradually began making contact and clashing. With Gaul's support, Columbia declared its independence from Victoria. However, barely a decade after that, the Battle of the Four Emperors led to Gaul's destruction. Columbia and Leithanien's war over Bol\u00edvar continues to this day. Not only that, but the conflicts between nations sped up their communications with one another. Countries began to enter into trade agreements, establishing trading companies in each other's territories... None of them could keep themselves isolated anymore, and they all began to find ways to get along with the other nations. And when all of this was happening, Kjerag was completely oblivious. And now that the danger is at our doorstep, we're still oblivious. Victoria is busy with its own mess. Columbia's pioneering efforts are nearing its western mountain ranges. For a long time, Kjerag has been nothing but a barren, impoverished territory not worthy of occupation. But if Victoria solves its internal problems, if Columbia has any ideas about Victoria, or even if Kazimierz wants to head south.

I can't even win at chess anymore. Sometimes, a draw is a great victory. And other times, a draw is a crushing defeat. In my case... anything other than a great victory is a crushing defeat.

The Saintess... does not need anyone making decisions for her. But you nudged her at just the right moment, giving her a direction. Furthermore, you set the stage for her. And you would have me believe that you did all of this unintentionally? You certainly achieved this objective. You sought out Arctosz and Ratatos, made battle predictions for them preemptively, and provided a better plan to avoid war. This very much fits your way of doing things, Doctor. Even I could not predict that this situation could be resolved in such a peaceful manner. Surely, you understand why I was so eager to unite Kjerag under one banner. That's right. I don't particularly hate the Vine-Bear Court, nor am I in any rush to eradicate religion from these lands. Nor am I particularly dissatisfied with Arctosz's insularity or Ratatos's hesitation.

As for why he decided to make this show of grace, he decided to make an oath with the Saintess so that the she would take control of the Paleroche lands. Perhaps to cement the Saintess's status. The Browntail clan has signed an agreement of subordination to the Silverash clan. I can share some extra details with you. I have no desire to take over the Browntail clan; should Ratatos desire, her power would not be any less than it was in the past. There are no longer any left who desire stagnation, who refuse to budge, or would fret over costs and benefits. None stand in the way of Karlan Trade and Kjerag's development. This is an outcome I can accept, Doctor. But we ended up walking separate paths. And, this is the result of my past choices. I will take responsibility for it.

I don't claim to know why the Durins tend to expand their cities horizontally. Some kind of ingrained habit, I guess. But forget that. It doesn't mean they scout out resources horizontally as well.

No record of the 'Nian' has ever described her face, let alone her weaknesses. But a trip to Yan led me to some new discoveries.    Any culture with a long history will have its legends and folklore. Although some of it may have origins in more recent times, obscuring the truth.    Some theories suggest that firecrackers were the forerunner of modern Originium explosives technology, originating in some devotional folk practices.    And what are the evil spirits in these ancient legends?    'Fear the noise, fear the flame.'    If the Nian's function really is 'smelting', then a firecracker doesn't pose a threat to her at all.    She... called herself a craftsman. Flame and noise are part of her work, or at least part of some kind of image she projects.    It's a theory I have to explain her utterly irrational ability to do these things without the use of Originium Arts.    I thought it was just a legend.... But it's worth a try.    She did flinch when I used some big, noisy flame Arts.    Let me say one last thing.    She's strong. There may be a way to destroy her, but the price will be high.    Try to avoid taking her head on. She doesn't like to kill, at least.    Second, using her power doesn't wear her out. If we get into a war of attrition with her, we're the ones who go down.    Third, for some reason, she has an interest in modern consumer goods.    The hunter traps the beast by taking advantage of its nature. And what we call 'personality' is just nature in a fancy package.    Finally, beware her sword and shield.

{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"Hm... Honestly, the blade you carry doesn't pose any kind of problem. There's a mountain of competitors with weapons and tricks a whole lot worse than that up their sleeves. Swords aren't high on the danger scale. Which is to say: even if you don't use yours, others will use theirs. Well, in that case... try a high-pressure water gun like this. Oh, it's a fairly specialized weapon. Fires high-pressure water rounds, hits hard, but won't cause major injury. Do you know how to work a crossbow? Let's give it a try. But before that, I'll explain the competition in detail. Firstly, its formal name is the 'Dossoles Warrior Champion.' It takes place across the entire city. The Mayor's purchased a huge number of drones and cams, as well as low-altitude aircraft, so nobody will miss a single moment. Not even the darkest, dankest corners of the city. Once the competition starts, we'll have drones custom-geared to follow each and every team too. And once the time hits, the TV station will split up into different main stages, making it convenient for the people to view the teams or content that they want. Ms. Candela's spared no effort in this respect. Okay. Before the official competition was ten days of prelims, which is what you just took part in. Every day, there've been two to three prelims held all over the city. No. I don't know whether to call you lucky or unlucky, honestly. You crashed the single most dangerous kind. There's been a huge variety of prelim types, like eating contests, racewalks, sprints, et cetera. The scrimmage topped everything else for risk.","response":"(\"protagonist\": Yes); \n(\"antagonist\": No); \n(\"extrovert\": Yes); \n(\"introvert\": No); \n(\"ally\/companion\": Yes); \n(\"trickster\": No); \n(\"shadow\": No); \n(\"shapeshifter\": No); \n(\"warrior\": Yes); \n(\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":1.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":1.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":1.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}
{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"That's right. No other prelim reward would've ever been as generous as the pure gold statue you got. And that's why so many people join the scrimmage, even though it's so dangerous. Aha, your reactions tell me you two are very astute. I imagine you're worried that the competition won't be kind to entrants who won the more entertainment-focused prelims. I'll cut straight to the chase, then. No, it won't be an easy time for them. Like I said, people want to see more than simple stamina matches. It's a fight to excite. That's why the weaker ones are up against greater threats. But you don't need to worry too much, Miss Ch'en. The Mayor's taken that into account. There's an article in the rules on it. Have you noticed another problem? The competition doesn't restrict Originium Arts. If someone could boost their own speed with it\u2014 \u2014just to exaggerate, if they could reach the goal in an instant, then that'd be tough luck to everyone else, right? They do exist, of course. To counteract that, the Mayor is giving the viewers the right to choose. To be precise, the audience decides who doesn't deserve to be a winner. After every round of the competition, there'll be a viewer voting segment, and the votes could completely reshape the final rankings. Using flashy means to gain victory is naturally self-explanatory. Winning too boring might get you eliminated, but drop enough jaws and you could tip the scales when you'd otherwise fall just short. Of course, there's no guarantee that's how it goes. With all of that, no one knows who the winner truly is, until the final moment.","response":"(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": No); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": No); (\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":0.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}
{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"Right. And not just in combat. Dazzling fights are the most direct way to make eyes boggle, but blindsiding with actions can net you cheers too. That's the rule that gives contestants a fighting chance, even if they're wipeouts in combat. You two really have seen it all. The Mayor's visited Kazimierz several times before. Apparently, her trade agreement with Lungmen was signed there too. In any case, these are rules that favor the strong, so expect plenty of those who scraped through the prelims for a prize will have to forfeit at the official thing. That's why the number of teams competing always changes a little. In short, this is a contest with no differentiation, no limits, and no holds barred on the road to victory\u2014but\u2014the winner needs the whole city's approval. I know that. Your goal is to use the championship to carry out your mission from Ms. Candela, right? I'll be there to help with that, too. Haha, that's for sure. And the two of you have probably noticed, the battle for popularity runs through the whole championship. In other words, it began the moment the preliminaries did. And given how you entered midway into the scrimmage and stomped all over peak danger, it might not be a stretch to say your team is the hottest topic right now. You can think of winning as a service to your goal, and enjoy what the competition has for you. Sure thing. Come over here. I'll explain with a map. The competition's split into three rounds. Round 1, you're looking for gold in an empty neighborhood. There are twenty bars of pure gold to find in this area, and competing teams need at least one. Hand them in to staff at the workers' area afterward, and you're through.","response":"(\"protagonist\": Yes); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": Yes); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": No); (\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":1.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":1.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}
{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"Right. During the competition, everyone living in this area will be housed in hotels elsewhere, and the city government will cover their expenses. They'll cover the costs of any and all damage to housing, equipment, et cetera, as a result of the competition, too. Most look forward to it, thanks to that. There are even some dying to compete, just so they can smash their own homes up to get them rebuilt free of charge. That's right. Some choose to search, some to steal, and some to cut down on rival numbers first. Round 1 won't end until the last of the gold is handed in to staff. It sure is. Nothing's stopping you if you want more gold and don't actively hand it in, but you shoulder all the corresponding risk as well. Hm... theoretically, it's possible, but practically, it's never happened before, so I'm not sure myself. Is that what you're planning, Miss Lin? Once Round 1 is over, there'll be two days' downtime, where the victors are invited to take part in all sorts of spin-off events, and attend a bunch of fancy dinner parties. Good for bolstering your popularity outside the arena, in a sense. Then it's Round 2. You should be relatively familiar with it; it's a traditional triathlon event. Traditional. First you run a route along the beach, then cycle a circuit around the city, and finally, return to the start at the beach for a swim, all the way until the finish: a cruise ship in the middle of the sea. But, of course, there's all kinds of ways to win. Certainly. However, the Mayor has put a substantial fighting force to block the shortcuts, so essentially, taking them means a violent breakthrough.","response":"(\"protagonist\": No); (\"antagonist\": No); (\"extrovert\": Yes); (\"introvert\": No); (\"ally\/companion\": Yes); (\"trickster\": No); (\"shadow\": No); (\"shapeshifter\": No); (\"warrior\": No); (\"sage\/wise one\": No)","protagonist":0.0,"antagonist":0.0,"extrovert":1.0,"introvert":0.0,"ally_companion":1.0,"trickster":0.0,"shadow":0.0,"shapeshifter":0.0,"warrior":0.0,"sage_wise_one":0.0}
{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"After Round 2 ends, there's two days of downtime just like Round 1, but these ones will be more of a pure rest. The victors get the pleasure of all the entertainment and facilities aboard a cruise ship normally reserved for the rich, free of charge. Honestly, it's the part a lot of competitors aim for when they're entering, but it's not the end of things. Because of Round 3, the final round of the competition. Highly simple, and highly cruel. It's a battle royale with the whole ship as fair game. Survive until you're the last team standing to be crowned winner. Which means, in Round 3, there's practically no space for clever tricks. Oh, right. You probably remember me saying back at the arena, team size limit is seven. In principle, the more teammates, the more you can do. That's right. And it's not like there aren't limits, too. You aren't allowed communications equipment during the contest. That means you need to have your plan ready from the start, and if your team splinters, then you've got to be ready for them to come at you. Yes. That's why there's pros and cons to your team being big or small. Two days. These two days are downtime. Head through there. You'll find a small firing range and a training ground. Will you be fine, Miss Lin? Well... this is something. We've landed two real wild cases. What? Er, alright.

{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"Hold on. How about this...? I know you two don't deal too well with each other, but seeing as you are, in fact, a team, at least try and act as much of a team as you can.

Ms. Candela is like the city's sun, and this city only exists because of her. That's not the right answer, though. The mayor is a prideful person, but she wouldn't compare herself with the sun. Her pride is above even the sun. She wouldn't put herself on the same level as two other suns. She would say all three suns are hers. The answer's simple. It's on your papa's boat.

{"character":"Ernesto","chunk":"Right. You studied abroad in Victoria, and Victoria hasn't really meddled in Bol\u00edvar's affairs that much. If you haven't ever gone out of your way to look into our history, I can't fault you for not being familiar with the subject. Before Iberia discovered this place, it was nothing more than a plain called Bol\u00edvar. The Iberians found many Originium veins here, and that's why they decided to stay and turn it into a colony. Then, one way or another, Iberia's rule here came to an end. After a period of chaos that lasted 130 years, the Leithanians came. And that's how Bol\u00edvar became a Leithanian dependency. About two centuries ago, Bol\u00edvar evolved from a dependency to a vassal state. That's the Singas dynasty. You could say that was when Bol\u00edvar became the Bol\u00edvar we know, although the Singas dynasty's subjects never called themselves Bol\u00edvarians. Then, during the Witch King's reign, Leithanien tried to stir up civil unrest in Columbia through Bol\u00edvar. But not only did their efforts fail, Bol\u00edvar was actually invaded by Columbia, and that was when the Coalition government was established. And from then on, Bol\u00edvar was split between both Columbia and Leithanien. Leithanien didn't really care about Bol\u00edvar that much, and while Columbia was teeming with ambition, Bol\u00edvar was too big for it to engulf at once. And that's how this tug-of-war started. Then, unable to bear the situation any longer, the Bol\u00edvarians chose to take up arms. They formed a resistance movement and called themselves True Bol\u00edvarians, and they swore they would make Bol\u00edvar a real country one day. Unfortunately, things only took a turn for the worse. True Bol\u00edvarians's establishment only dragged Bol\u00edvar into even deeper waters. In the end, this is the mess that Bol\u00edvar has found itself in. The Coalition government, the Singas dynasty, and True Bol\u00edvarians. The three sides are in a perpetual war with no end in sight. Not only that, but this city Dossoles emerged out of the chaos. Under Ms. Candela's management, not only is the city well-liked by all three governments, but all three of them even owe Ms. Candela many a time. That's because this city has resources that they can't just ignore, and Ms. Candela also has the power to defend this city. And so, the city has become a place that all Bol\u00edvarians set their sights on. Every Bol\u00edvarian who's fed up with war dreams of saving up enough money to come here for a vacation, or even get a fresh start here. Miss Ch'en, you and Miss Lin are good at heart, so I am sure you both are well aware. Aware of what kind of a place this city is. Let's say the three governments are still intent on uniting all of Bol\u00edvar. That's something that would never cross Ms. Candela's mind. To put it bluntly, Miss Ch'en, this city's prosperity was built on top of the pain and suffering of all Bol\u00edvarians. And the more prosperous it is, the less hope this country has.

Ms. Candela once said that her father, a former mayor of this city, was a useless piece of trash who, propped up by the Leithanian government, could do nothing but take bribes. Before the outraged citizens could kick his office's door in, he fled the country with his wife and daughter. Although her father was a piece of trash through and through, as the daughter of the scumbag, she followed her father first to Kazimierz, then to Victoria. Through her father, she learned all the ways that wealth could be used. She learned the very meaning of wealth. Then, she came back to the city and became its mayor. At a time when the resistance was nothing but a huge failure, the city found itself producing the finest liquor, coffee, and confectionaries. Dossoles tequila can even be found in Leithanien and Columbia. And while the Leithanians and Columbians were bickering at each other, the city transformed into a vacation hotspot of choice among the elite of both sides. They had no choice but to follow Ms. Candela's rule: You may never fight here. And it's not military might or prowess that makes them willingly follow this rule. It's wealth, entertainment, and all the luxuries this place has to offer. It's the city's colorful facade. I know that's not how I should see all this. But I can't keep myself from thinking this way\u2014 From a certain point of view, and all things considered, perhaps Ms. Candela loves this country far more than my father. All he is doing is blindly chasing this construct of a country. He wants a country called Bol\u00edvar. Its borders were defined when it was still a colony. Its citizens are those who have always lived on these lands. What comes next? How will this country take on the Columbians and Leithanians in this conflict? How will it continue to develop as a country? He doesn't know. He doesn't actually know what kind of a country Bol\u00edvar is. But Ms. Candela found a path forward.

Mr. Liang doesn't have much of a choice himself. If only... *Sigh*... No, it wouldn't have mattered.   Isn't her presence in Shangshu the reason everything has gotten so out of hand?

The Feranmuts may be powerful, but we won the hunt a thousand years ago. Yan is even stronger now. There is nothing to fear.

Heaven and earth, the moon and stars, wind and rain, the changing of the seasons... it is unfathomable, beyond our reckoning. The Feranmuts were the same to the people of the time. Ignorance breeds fear, which becomes twisted into religion. To those madmen, we are the ones we are the outsiders. We are the traitors. The Shanhaizhong's activities never waned, even after the Feranmuts faded from the public eye. In the past centuries, they have absorbed bandits, pirates, robbers, and other sorts of villains. They use the Feranmuts as a shadow to conceal their activities. Sui Regulator records indicate that the Shanhaizhong have done unmeasurable harm in the name of the Feranmuts. The scale of their deeds is so widespread that complete elimination is impossible, and the vileness of their acts horrifying. They have started to reach out to the proxies of your kin.
