And in the countless settlements that dot the land, I have never yet found one where the descendants knew the location of the graves of their ancestors.   There is a form of burial called the Tombway, it denotes a part of a nomadic city's pathing as the burial ground, where the dead will be tossed from the city, with the passing cycle as a form of honor.

Kashchey ruled Lungmen from the shadows, and saw us as thorns in his side. We knew we had no choice but to depose him... it was the only way to give us a future in the city.    Here, this grave, is the farthest Lungmen had ever been.   After we beat Kashchey and exiled him from Lungmen, the city sat a few dozen miles away, bright, and full of hope. Our future awaited us.   We drank, talked, laughed, enjoyed ourselves without a thought to our remaining fuel.   We very nearly died of thirst until Adams, that sick old tiger, coughed up his car to come get us. Boy did he give Edward and I the business after that.   Oh... he wasn't as old then. Nor was he as sick, or ferocious.    But who cares? We were all having a good time.    Lin was laughing... laughing like we didn't have blood on our hands... laughing like we were boys in the time of our lives.   Edward was the scion of the highest Londinium nobility. And we were keeping that secret in Lungmen. But Kashchey already knew, he may have long since started plotting.     He told my jealous twin and the Shadow of Londinium about Edward and my sister... about their relationship...   I was forced to choose between Edward or my sister's unborn child.   I hid it for ten years after Edward died. Only my brother and Kashchey knew. But now, Edward and my sister are both gone from this world.

I was born in a mine in the northwest tundra.   The mine was small and remote, not part of any city, and there are with no settlements around. There was nothing to see but snow all year round.   This mine was hell, built only to spread death and slavery. There are countless such mines in the snowy plains.   My birth parents were miners in that hellish pit.   My grandmother stayed with me through my early years of learning to speak, but she never told me what crimes my parents committed to be sentenced to mine labor.   Later, when I was a little older, I asked around in the mines and learned that both of my parents had opposed the Emperor's wartime plans.   Their arrest was also an accident. The bottom two lines of the arrest warrant were blank, so the sergeant in charge of the search haphazardly copied the name on the door plate.   Without trial, my parents lost their names and moved from their warm little town to the cold Northlands to serve a centuries-long sentence.   Of course, no one would even live to see that, let alone ever leave alive.   My grandmother was sentenced to the mines together as a 'harborer' of criminals, and moved with them.   In fact, all the miners there had very similar experiences.   Naturally, both of my parents contracted Oripathy down there. All the miners did.   Now, even if you escaped this mine, no one would believe a word you said. You're just an Infected person, the most horrible, vicious and extreme of the Oripathy patients.   However, the overseer of the mine, a certain Ursus military garrison, believed that the natural death rate of the Infected was still too slow.   They drew straws to decide the fates of the Oripathy sufferers, killing them for fun and sport.   Maybe it was the miners that drove them crazy, rather than the snow. And maybe the Infected didn't count as human in their eyes.   When I was five, my parents drew the black lot.   When I was ten, my grandmother drew the black lot.   When I was eleven, I drew the black lot myself, but it didn't matter, they didn't care about the lottery anymore. They just want to abandon the whole mine.   By that time, all the adult Infected in the mines had died out, and the Emperor's new policies had left the mines starved of people.   Under orders, the Ursus overseers prepared to go ahead and execute the last of the Infected.... A few sick children.   Afterwards they would collapse the mines to serve as mass graves for the infected, to cover up their sins.   I learned later, in my travels, that they do this all the time.   I was sad. I was in pain.   I had broken a lot of ore. I lived with other kids in the mines, we loved each other, and we were all going to die for nothing.

Still, his son became a scholar, a Wendigo scholar.... Perhaps the first in the history of Ursus.   Buldrokkas'tee contracted Oripathy during his last battle.   His men helped him hide his illness, and he had even hidden everything from his own son. He didn't want to drag his son down with him, only to die in some dark corner of the world with the disease.   However, during the 'Great Rebellion', his son was campaigning for the rights of the Infected. Long out of touch with his father, the son still sees him as an Ursus puppet.   And he was. They commanded him to keep order in his own ranks at all costs. He allowed the soldiers to use their weapons, conflict erupted, and corpses piled in the snow drifts.   That's who he was.

Even the things she said I found impractical to the point of ridiculousness.   But she said to us, 'Come with me.'   She fought with us, and with her strength and ideals, she became our friend.

Or... can it? (Whisper) You're right. We took our first steps together. I mean, you're right. Maybe I was mistaken. You took the words right out of my mouth, Saria. After forcibly entering a Trimountian military spec ops bureau, what could <i>you</i> possibly be doing? Let me guess. You want to find something to chase after that airborne gizmo. Maybe hijack a heavy duty army drone and tie yourself onto it, for example? Or is that thinking a little too simple, Director Saria? I never took you for the impulsive type. Would you look at that, how sad. The only three... well, fine, Scientific Investigation's doesn't count.

I was just waiting for you. Listen, Saria. I'm not here to get in your way. And I said, 'listen.' The 'Horizon Arc Project' isn't just that superweapon Kristen's floating through the air. It's a complete strategic program. I tapped into some connections to borrow an aircraft they use to service 'Arc-01,' and blew up the rest while I was at it. Let me be clear. Look across all of Columbia, and you'll find very few passenger aircraft safely able to fly near barrier altitude. They won't need much time to scramble high-altitude craft from the District, but for you, and for me, that time is more than enough. There's the same old Saria I know. As though you'd have the ability to quell every single problem, even if I wasn't there to help. But I don't have a single shred of doubt about this. In your own words, there is no reason we should clash. H.A.M.H.R.R. has reached the S.H.A.F.T.'s aerial space, and the S.H.A.F.T. has begun accumulating energy. If we let this situation unfold as is, then no matter what Kristen's up to, this <i>will</i> end with the Department of Defense exposed to the winds of scrutiny. And I'm sure we all know how Rhine Lab, as an 'accessory' to it, will end up. Exactly. But I'm not about to give in. We can still make it in time. We can bring H.A.M.H.R.R. back down again in a safe descent before the energy excitation, and then there will be room to pull everything back. Does it matter?

Everyone else is either out to see what research funds Rhine can get them, or their only interest is in what Kristen's doing. You may have considered how Kristen leaves the picture, but have you considered what will become of the company afterwards? Yes, I know, you've all been captured by her charm and charisma. With a little soul-searching, I have to wonder if I wasn't too? Of course I was. But Rhine Lab is ours, of the blood <i>we</i> shed. I can't accept her setting fire to everything that I gave the sweat of my brow for. No matter what reason drives it. So I can swallow being a tuskbeast of the military, because I want to pull Rhine back from the brink. Is that so wrong? They're very Director of Defense-like words, aren't they?

After working with her for so long, we know what kind of woman she is, and of course, you would understand her better than I ever could. Saria, tell me straight. What's going on in that brain of hers? How far is she going to take this? Conjecture. Very cautious terminology. Go on, then. Are you conjecturing or not? This definitely carries a little risk. Suit yourself. Are you actually able to run this thing, though? You said you knew how to pilot this thing! I\u2014ungh\u2014! Saria! Check the window! The engine is on fire! The thing looks ready to explode! What do you mean, <i>no huge concern?!</i> What are you\u2014 Opening the hatch? What do you mean, heading out? In midair?! Saria, Saria! This whole thing's shaking!

I suppose so. Learning to pilot in your college days... The army still thinks this is some kind of superweapon. This equipment, these monitor devices and readouts... Nasti built this to be the best lab in all of Trimounts. Or perhaps this was just the first step of some grand experiment? That devil... just how much did she hide from me? I never thought her participation went that deep. Hold on, Saria. I see a military transporter. They got here faster than we anticipated. They must be nearby. I assume they'll finish boarding before long. We need to hurry before they take over this place fully... Saria? ...... Alright, alright. Once I get back, I'm having a nice, long talk with Jara. Preferably to double my stock options. Kristen, Kristen... Sure enough, you set this plan into motion a long time ago. Everything you did for the DOD was a fancy show. Hah! What's the principle behind all this? The efficiency and stability of this high-energy confinement field... I've never heard of anything like that before. ...One of the foremost experts. My God...

The wobbling is a normal phenomenon of high-energy confinement fields. I'm talking about... the unit of measurement. You can take a guess how many times larger this unit is than the one on the instruments in my lab. The energy it absorbed just now is enough to power every single one of Columbia's nomadic cities for at least six months. And it's showing no signs of stopping. And we're now in the center of the laboratory carrying this tremendous amount of energy. Even if Nasti is a genius, she can't create a receptacle that stores energy in amounts beyond the realm of cognition. No matter what direction it ultimately focuses the energy in, once the second-degree excitation begins, this lab won't be safe from the consequences. If her ultimate goal is the sky, and the sky can only be contested with this amount of energy... What exactly is up there? And it's doomed to fail.
