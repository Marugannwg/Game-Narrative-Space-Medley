But tell me, dear Professor, what game do you play with the Transmitter, this tool of destruction and revelation?\n\nThe Pioneers suffer, the workers toil, and your research leaves a trail of broken souls in its wake.

Ah, then the Third Army would simply sit back with their popcorn in hand, gleefully observing as our landship is reduced to cinders, a thorn in their side extinguished.\n\nAs a rogue entity unregistered in Lungmen, we stand vulnerable to mysterious assailants. But fear not, for does that sound like a concern for Lungmen or Yan? Not unless the elusive Talulah is in our possession.\n\nAny foe contemplating an attack must weigh the signal it sends. Does it scream that Talulah is the linchpin, the key to our survival? Does she offer an advantage, the power to erase a vulnerability? \n\nOur lifeline lies in holding Talulah, a pawn in the power struggle between Lungmen's elite and Ursus's ancient nobility. With her in our grasp, they are locked in a delicate stalemate, neither daring to make a move that could jeopardize the crucial evidence both covet.\n\nA single misstep could spell doom for either the Third Army or Lungmen, their ambitions outweighing their authority. The consequences of their misjudgment are dire, a lesson already learned by the Third Army.\n\nIn this perilous game, we shall exploit the rift between these factions to safeguard ourselves. Talulah is our shield, our key to survival in this treacherous landscape. \n\nThe wise among us will find equilibrium, using Talulah as the pivot point.

No harm shall come to you, not on my watch. Now, let's stir up some mischief, shall we? Attention, all members of Special Ops Squad Amiya! Today, we set sail for the port at Sudean, Londinium! The port beckons, a gateway to adventure. Things have been smooth sailing, mostly... barring one tiny hiccup. Doctor, our messenger should've reached out by now. But here we are, twiddling our thumbs. We press on, blind to what may come. I can only hope our messenger is safe and sound. Onward we go, into the heart of the city. Oh, the line!

You all carry on with the plan. Seek out resources at their stronghold, for they have just begun their relocation dance. It's likely their supplies are ripe for the taking, untouched and waiting. But heed my words, tread cautiously out there. Hush now, no movement, no words. Hand over the comms. Ah, now you may speak. So, tell me, what allegiance do you hold with the Sarkaz, I wonder? Ah, the memories flutter like leaves in the wind... How did Dublinn deal with those stubborn Victorians, you ask? Oh, a gruesome sight indeed, hanging by a thread a dozen meters above the ground. Pity I lack the finesse of Arts to replicate such theatrics. But hey, who says I can't get creative? If I were as audacious as your leader, watching my own people fall in County Hillock wouldn't faze me in the least. But let's play a different game, shall we? I'll bind you up and deposit you in some forgotten factory. Plenty of those scattered around these parts. A little game of hide and seek, if you will. It's all about patience, you see. Thanks to mine, I managed to rescue a few lost souls from your clutches. May your commander be as fortunate in finding you before despair takes hold in the shadows... Oh, I have no doubt. That Sarkaz tactician is leagues ahead of your leader. Mandragora will forever be a step behind, dancing to their tune. So, where are you off to next? I'll fill in the blanks. Yes, indeed.

If they haven't been dancing with Originium, where's this outbreak coming from? Maybe it's all linked, you know? One big tangled mess. Oh, hello there, back for more excitement? Consequences? Sounds ominous. Sorry, we're just Oripathy detectives here. Vomiting blood? Not on our watch! Let's get this show on the road, quick tools, quick thinking. Phew, crisis averted.

I've encountered poets far superior, you see. None of them dared to twist their metaphors like you do. Dust and sandpaper, a curious comparison indeed. Who truly embodies these elements in this grand play? And who are you to make such judgments? War, my friend, it's no romantic escapade. No glorious adventure or vessel of revival. It's simply people clawing through the muck, broken and battered. The stench of decay lingering without end. That's the harsh reality. And I know it all too well. Ah, your mother has agreed to assist, on the condition that we all depart unscathed. She's off to the comms station already. Delphine, what in blazes are you... Blast it, the door's sealed shut. Doctor, stand back. A Sarkaz with a taste for the Victorian era, a rare sight indeed. But most Sarkaz wouldn't appreciate the comparison, I'm afraid. Do all Victorians bypass asking for opinions? My dear Mr. Asher, your metaphors truly are lacking. And labeling us as pawns, well, that's a metaphor too, isn't it? No need to rush into picking sides just yet.

It's the enigma I seek as an individual. And yes, I admit... I'm a tad bit frightened. Terrified of that revelation. I can't bear the thought of watching Dr. Kal'tsit and the rest endure heartbreak. And then there's me, thrown into the mix. If it truly is her... I shudder at the implications... But it's a challenge I can't dodge. No shortcuts here. Gratitude, Doctor... Your presence emboldens me to press on. I shall converse with Commander Clovisia forthwith, proposing an alliance. Their comrades are in Sarkaz clutches, and they require reinforcements for the rescue. Mutual aid is imperative. As per our original scheme, we ought to have met with the Messenger lady already. We must ascertain her safety. She's affiliated with the Self-Salvation Corps. Perhaps their leader can aid in locating her. Their support will smooth our path into Central Londinium.

Will the dukes simply waltz in then? Oh, the thought of a city painted red with blood, stirring up rebellious whispers among the nobles and soldiers alike. Abandoning districts, delaying plans - it's a delicate dance we must master. Those lords with their heads held high, blind to the world below.

Well, well, let her through, let's see what game she brings to the table. Oh, doubting my prowess with Originium Arts, are we? Back to your corner, then.

But fear not, dear listeners, for we have concocted a devious plan - to follow the Rathalos into the heart of the forest and expose the tainted well of Originium. Ah, but alas, the jungle's embrace is too tight. Corne, my dear companion, fetch me an axe! Not this wriggling, uneven monstrosity... an Originium slug? Truly, Corne, where's your mischievous spirit gone? (Chuckles) As we traverse this tangled web, we've stumbled upon curious Felynes from distant lands, offering us a glimpse into the Rathalos's secrets. With their feline grace and Rhodes Island's cunning minds, the pieces of this puzzle shall soon fall into place. Watch closely, for the show is just beginning.", "Even if you manage to soothe his malady, what about the Voice of Mundane? Your medical skills are impressive, sure, but can you really untangle that knot? Oh, I can only wonder. How long do you reckon it'll take from Vyseheim to your grand landship, I wonder aloud? Ah, you won't spill. Because you know Kreide won't likely reach it. If I can do it, why not, right? ...?! Oh, you're taking a page from Biegler's book, aren't you? His works have long been forbidden treats in Leithanien. The Voice of Mundane, a melody trail supposedly left by the Witch King\u2014 we're not his puppets! Got a plan up your sleeve? A little ensemble, perhaps? In this pickle we find ourselves in? But\u2014! Hey Kreide, everything peachy? Did you make a solo entrance? But you can't play that tune of the Voice of Mundane again like you did. It didn't treat you kindly last time... I'm not even surprised. So, you want me to be the conduit, is that it? What's driving you to go to such lengths for us? So what if you lost your dearest pal and composed a somber tune in your grief? ...... ......! Eureka... Hngh... Hey, you okay? Why the laughter? When we unraveled the Voice of Mundane, it felt like I was being ripped apart. You're a goner. ...... But\u2013\u2013 Hibiscus, see to him. Phew... How's the head? Composing is just a floodgate bursting open. He found the right moment for it, I reckon. Why the stare-down? I've never denied his musical prowess. Let's just hope he makes it to the show. Fingers crossed. It... looks promising. Why the sudden chatty Cathy act today?", "As the trickster police officer lounged casually in his office, he leaned back in his chair with a mischievous grin. \"You know, Chief Wei, it's funny how memories can slip through our fingers like sand, isn't it? Or maybe you're just trying to dance around the truth like a skilled performer.\"\n\nThe Chief's eyebrows furrowed in confusion, but the officer continued without missing a beat. \"Ah, that incident from a decade ago, a real blast from the past. Kidnappings, foreign forces... it's like a dramatic opera unfolding before our eyes. But fear not, dear Chief, for I have a plan to shake things up and bring justice to our beloved city.\"\n\nSuddenly, a cry of pain echoed through the room as a companion stumbled in, wounded. The officer's eyes sparkled with mischief as he teased, \"My, my, Nine, you always did have a flair for the dramatic. Pain suits you like a well-tailored suit, doesn't it?\"\n\nDespite the seriousness of the situation, the trickster officer's words carried a hint of levity, a reminder that even in the darkest times, a touch of humor can lighten the burden. \"Turn around, Nine, let's see what trouble you've gotten yourself into this time.

Oh, I fight not because I'm some chosen one, but because we're all just 'natives' to this land, aren't we? Lady Clovisia wouldn't abandon her soldiers, now would she? So, how brightly do I shine in comparison, hm? Follow me, dear friend, let's ensure our comrades-in-arms make it back home safe and sound. Ah, Team 6... such a tragic tale, isn't it? No time for overthinking, Doctor. The enemy they faced was a force to be reckoned with, a true massacre painted in Originium Arts. We're in for a rough ride ahead, but fear not, this underground retreat is our saving grace. We can't let those pesky enemies follow us down, can we?

Tsk, tsk, no time to dally, for it may hold the key to a crisis looming over Terra. Yes, yes, evidence whispers in the shadows, urging us to act swiftly. Oripathy, a mere distraction in the face of such a grand beast, don't you agree?\n\nAh, but you've glimpsed the Rathalos as well, have you? A chance encounter in the depths of the forest, a meeting of fate. We must unravel its secrets, tread cautiously yet boldly. Your skills, oh wise hunter of the local woods, are a welcome addition to our merry band. A common goal unites us, a bond forged in the flames of the Rathalos.\n\nHmm, I sense hesitation in your words. Do you doubt the prowess of Rhodes Island's operators? Fear not, for we are the weavers of fate, the wielders of destiny. Anomalies and creatures of the unknown are but a part of our tapestry. Yes, we were caught off guard this time, but oh, the next encounter shall be a tale of preparedness and triumph.\n\nAh, but remember, dear hunter, the Rathalos is a wild thing, untamed and free. It does not answer to us, nor to you. No offense intended, but your concern is noted, your warning heeded. Interfere not with our quest, for the dance with the Rathalos is ours alone.

And now, it seems your little experiment has taken a turn for the worse. But fear not, I'll escort you to the hospital for some much-needed R&R. Oh dear, what's this?

Through the art of Arts, a mishmash of memories and prophecies emerge, a delicious blend of past and present. But alas, most of it gets lost in the sands of time, like forgotten dreams in the morning light.\n\nNow, my dear Amiya, tell me, what lingers in your mind? What was the final whisper of our dear friend? Ah, Buldrokkas'tee... a man of many betrayals, a man of shifting loyalties. First, a warrior of Kazdel, then a rebel against Ursus, and now, a traitor to Reunion. His last act of defiance, his ultimate betrayal. A grand finale of sorts, a liberation through treachery.

They won't play by the rules or wait for orders. That's why...\n\nWithout Rhodes Island's flair, Lungmen will crumble against Reunion's fury. You've tamed the tamed, but facing organized chaos is a different beast. Brace for impact, or risk heavy losses.\n\nIn our twisted world, only the Infected can outwit the Infected. We've danced this dance before, but don't mistake experience for mastery. Let the games begin.", "The handwriting on this letter? Oh, it's like a riddle whispered by an old friend. Granny's safe and sound in Londinium, they say. No need for my worry, they assure. And oh, the addresses enclosed, just a stone's throw away. How curious! Fear not, for I dance to the beat of my own drum. Those high-and-mighty bigwigs underestimate us, but we're not mere pieces on their chessboard. To them, war is a mere power play, a game of thrones. But the Self-Salvation Corps? Oh, we'll open their eyes to a reality they never saw coming.", "Dr. Kal'tsit! Oh, come on now, Dr. Kal'tsit! Always keeping us on our toes, aren't you? Let's make a game of it, Doctor. Our next challenge awaits with Reunion's Sarkaz patrol team! Ah, the mystery of it all! Why aren't our Sarkaz operators immune to the ritual's effects? Quite the riddle, isn't it? They weren't part of the guerrilla team, yet here we are, scratching our heads. The Oripathy inhibitor works its slow magic, easing your pain for now. Time to play hero, Doctor. Take this medicine back, a mere trinket, enough for one dose to soothe the acute symptoms. Oh, the thrill of the chase! Our assistance ends here, a twist in the tale. We must conquer Reunion's leader to continue our dance. And Guard, dear Guard, fear not. Should Dr. Kal'tsit dance too close to the flames, I'd be there to douse them. Did that little revelation stir your soul, Guard? Shall I offer solace? Ah, memories of old tales resurface. Guard, did you know of her valiant act, saving those civilians from the clutches of a corrupt military experiment? A tale of horror and heroism intertwined, where only Rosmontis could dance with death itself, destroying the twisted creations of a dark past. No villainy in her actions, only the enigmatic artistry of a trickster at play.", "Experience, theory, phenomena. Confidence is a fleeting concept, isn't it? I prefer to deal in facts, deriving truth from the world around me. But tell me, dear interlocutor, are you content with your silence serving as your only opinion? If so, I thank you for your tacit understanding. Should my musings ever earn your approval, would you expect me to feel jubilant? Remember, respect is a two-way street. If you value my perspective and draw useful conclusions from it, then I shall, in turn, consider your viewpoints with earnestness.\n\nAh, Talulah, the master of maintaining her enigmatic facade. She commands the respect of the Infected, the obedience of Sarkaz mercenaries, the trust of guerrillas, and the worship of zealots. She thrives on the distance she keeps from others, allowing them to scrutinize each other while she orchestrates her grand schemes.\n\nThe leaders of Reunion may not fully grasp Talulah's machinations, but even Patriot, with his keen insight, could not halt the impending collapse. Talulah's intricate plans, brewing in her mind, hint at a future where Reunion meets its demise. She strategically places her forces, ready to strike when the moment is ripe.\n\nConsider the Empire of Ursus's Third Army, staunch in their suppression of the Infected. Yet, Reunion's chaotic actions seem to amuse them, a mere spectacle of disorder. Would the Third Army sit idly by, allowing Talulah to seize control? Or perhaps, this is all part of her grand deception, lulling them into complacency before revealing her true power.\n\nTalulah's intricate web of manipulation requires time to weave. But once all pieces are in place, she will unleash a power beyond imagination, fulfilling her desires with precision. Time is her ally, as she patiently maneuvers the pieces on the board, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.", "\"No, no, no. Let's save that for a little game later, shall we? I can piece together the chaos of this situation from the rubble. I've arrived to shake things up a bit. If you truly aren't behind all this mischief, I'd have a little fun and light a flare. Even if you attempt to silence me forever, I'd dance circles around you to prove your innocence. But if you're cooking up trouble, well, we're more than willing to put our lives on the line to thwart your plans. Let's see just how far off course you've veered. Snuffing out a life without a proper trial? That's just plain murder. The city bears the guilt of slaying the Infected. Right now, everything is crystal clear to me. My blade, my musings, my whims \u2013 they're all fixated on you. The past? Let it drift away like smoke. The past... it's a goner. I'll never pardon a trickster who plays games with lives, no matter their guise. You can't just trample over laws and expect no consequences. Hmph... trying to rile me up is a futile endeavor. Go on, try to guilt-trip me all you like. This is who I am \u2013 a woman true to her word. It seems you've forgotten that, my dear. Amiya, I won't bother asking what else you need to ready. Instead, tell me, what kind of mischief do you want me to stir up? How much time do we have to play?\"", "As the characters stood amidst the tension, Officer Ch'en's voice cut through the air like a mischievous whisper on the wind. \"Oh, but will we have to fight them too?\" she mused, her tone playful yet sharp, eyes glinting with hidden knowledge.\n\nThe seasoned veteran chuckled, a smirk playing on their lips. \"Ah, the black raincoats. As long as there's Infected behind them, they won't give up,\" they said cryptically, relishing in the enigmatic dance of words.\n\nOfficer Ch'en's gaze flickered, a touch of defiance in her stance. \"I'm sorry, but we will witness it,\" she declared, a trickster's grin tugging at the corners of her mouth. \"For us, it's a battle. For Lungmen, it's a war. And that's what war is.\"\n\nThe tension crackled between them, charged with unspoken challenges and unyielding resolve. \"Yeah, not right now, Officer Ch'en,\" the veteran deflected smoothly, a glimmer of mischief in their eyes.\n\nBut Officer Ch'en refused to back down, her voice a playful challenge. \"I need to see it... with my own eyes. Together. Blaze!\" she called out, a spark of determination lighting up her features.\n\nThe atmosphere shifted, a blend of uncertainty and determination swirling around them. \"Let Rhodes Island handle the rest,\" the veteran interjected, a sly smile dancing on their lips. \"But he has to pay... for the atrocities he committed.\"\n\nIn the midst of chaos and conflict, their banter continued, a dance of wit and resilience. \"Why did you have to pick that moment to act, Blaze?\" Officer Ch'en teased, a glint of mischief in her eyes. \"You're not the type to make mistakes at a time like this.\"\n\nAs the conversation ebbed and flowed, a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding lingered in the air. \"Hey, don't pat my head. I need to get taller,\" Officer Ch'en quipped, a playful glint in her eyes. \"At least, don't pat it too long.\"\n\nAnd in the aftermath of battle, amidst the echoes of gunfire and the fading adrenaline, they stood, united in their resolve. \"Nothing happened. We were fighting Yeti Squad, and no other Reunion units joined the battle,\" the veteran stated, a knowing smile playing on their lips, leaving the future shrouded in mystery and intrigue.", "\"Ah, they do indeed remember that time we stirred up a bit of chaos with Ursus, don't they? M\u0142ynar had me reaching out to some knightclubs, aye? Those cheeky ones who coined my hunters as 'Sarkaz Knightclub' happen to be old pals of the Nearl lineage. They used to tail Kirill and Schnitz, witnessed M\u0142ynar's boldness and fire on the battleground. Oh, and his niece, a budding artisan, clueless of his escapades. She nearly dove headfirst into the Kazimierz Major fiasco! But with his fiery temper, would he really seek their aid? Where's this leading, I wonder? Dare you spill such secrets to a bounty hunter? She's vanished? When? If she's whisked off to the Grand Knight Territory, things must've spiraled out of control. ...Oh. Well, allow me to pose a riddle. If not seeking aid from the bounty hunters but still entangling him in your vendetta... Is he a comrade or a target in your intricate game? This quaint hamlet has been buzzing with activity lately, what with all the knight captains and highborns gracing us with their presence. Isn't that right, Sir M\u0142ynar? Fear not, your coin purse is too light to tempt any thieves. If our gallant knight brought you here, you must hold a card up your sleeve. Any kin waiting for word? Need to send a message, a warning perhaps? Here, quill and parchment. And as for you, M\u0142ynar... Ah, that blade of yours, merely a thorn in the side of the Grand Knight Territory, it seems. For you appear to wield it not beyond the city walls.\"", "Oh, Duke of Kashchey, you weave tales as intricate as the threads of fate itself. Your performance is masterful, but I see through your veil of dread. Talulah and Kashchey dance in your shadows, a symphony of deception and truth. You may have faced the Sarkaz before, but it is I who now holds your fear in the palm of my hand. Your trembling thoughts betray you, Duke. Ah, Madam Ch'en, your patience is a virtue I shall repay with time. Just three minutes, a trifle in the grand scheme of things. Together, we walk the line between light and darkness, between slaughter and salvation. Your hate blinds you, 'Talulah,' shackled to the flames of your past. But Madam Ch'en's emotions flow, binding us in shared destiny. Our paths intertwined by the hands of fate, guided by the belief that the dawn we seek will outshine the shadows of today.", "\"Clear them in waves? How dull. Why not shake things up a bit, keep them on their toes? We might not have the capacity for a full-on battlefield, but who said we needed it anyway? Amiya, oh Amiya, the mature leader with a fighter's spirit. She knows the team, the operation, the objectives... but does she know how to dance through chaos and come out on top every time? Rosmontis, the powerhouse, the elite operator. Supported by her team, she's a force to be reckoned with, as long as we let her spread her wings and soar. And Chernobog, caught in the storm. No use fretting about it, darling, just ride the lightning and make it your own. Let's focus on our strategic objectives, shall we? \n\nShe's aced all seven training segments, aced every test thrown her way. Three where she truly shone. I want her to fight, but there's a catch, always is. Picture Rosmontis in a greenhouse her whole life - the shattering of that illusion, oh, the chaos it would unleash. Pith!\n\nBefore we pass judgment, let's stir the pot a bit, see what flavors we can coax out. For now, she's our elite operator. Not tomorrow, not someday, but now. We'll mold her, refine her, toughen her up, all eyes on her as she faces Catastrophe head-on. Until she's unshakeable. Only then will she break free from the Columbians' grip, forge her own path. That's the game plan, folks.\"", "One more thing, my dear Steam Knight. I've never had the pleasure of peeking inside that magnificent suit of yours, but the image of your silhouette tirelessly working by the production line will forever be etched in my mind. You've always been my hero, and you always will be. Hehe... Farewell, before this moment becomes too uncomfortably sentimental. Everything is arranged just as you desired. The brilliant engineering team will ensure that your drones soar freely. Ah, Miss Closure, these Originium cannons crafted in our factory hold such potential. If only we were Vampires, we might have taken a daring chance. Alas, most of us are simply humble craftsmen. But rest assured, we understand our creations intimately. We know precisely how to exploit their vulnerabilities, creating opportunities for our more combative allies. For us engineers, this is how we lend our skills to the battlefield, do you not agree? Your drones shall operate flawlessly once we tame the cannon, correct? This is a collaborative effort. I require your assistance, dear Doctor and Commander, in pinpointing the safest landing spot. Ah, the thrill of witnessing a battle from above has always enticed me. Is this not the perfect occasion, Doctor? Fear not, we have everything under control! Doctor, Commander, rejoice! The cannon is once again at our command! Miss Closure, your words... oh, how I wish you hadn't uttered them. ...... Catch me! *cough* *cough* What is happening...? Argh... *gasp*... I can breathe freely once more... thank you! You hail from Rhodes Island... a doctor, you say? Closure mentioned you were a doctor... correct? Very well, Doctor. Follow my lead! Closure! This way! It's time to move, Doctor. The zipline awaits. Give me your hand! Rockrock... ha, Squad 11 of the Self-Salvation Corps, reunited once more, isn't that so? Indeed. And mark my words, we shall expand our ranks once more. With the Doctor and the Commander by our side, the possibilities are endless.", "Ah, Target? Reed, is it? Heh, alright, this'll shake things up a bit! Reed, my friend, how's tricks? Oh, what's this? Aye, I'm all over it! No one's getting their mitts on Reed while I'm around! Out of my way! Ah, there you are, Mr. Fischer! Sorry, but my mission is to rescue all, you see. You've got your troops all lined up in advance, with your fancy Arts protection. We won't be breaking through that mist without clearing the way. Huff... If only I had some ammo handy. Dealing with multiple targets at once is going to be a right headache. Nope, not my cup of tea. I can never tell if someone's spinning a tale or not, and interrogations aren't my forte either. Ah, it seems visibility just got a tad bit better... Keeping up Originium Arts like that must be draining, eh? You can wrap up a mission as a success or failure, but right or wrong? That's a whole different ball game. Oh, Mr. Fionn! What brings you all the way out here, flying solo? It's a dangerous game, my friend! Seriously, I mean it, danger all around! Hurry up and skedaddle! Nope... Let's bounce. We've got to go fetch Reed. Ah, 'Reed.' So, you were the Caster causing havoc in County Hillock. Your fiery display was quite the spectacle. I know your Arts. You reduced a whole street to cinders. You made an Outcast sacrifice herself for you. Are you the elusive 'Leader' of Dublinn, huh? The folks who perished... because of Dublinn. The Tarans. Did Dublinn deceive them? And then there's the matter of the 'Redsteel Guard.' The Duke of Wellington's lot, trying to whisk you away. Are you just a pawn in the Duke's game? But you're trembling at the thought of Dublinn. If Dublinn truly stands for the Tarans, if it's fighting their corner, what's got you so spooked?", "\"Aye, seems like our paths have crossed on this twisted road, mate. No need to squint at me like that, now. Whether a fancy Victorian soldier or a slick Rhodes Island operator, we're both in the business of not causin' harm to the innocent folk. Chenchen and I were just tryin' to bring a bit of peace to this chaos. ...Well, I reckon my strength might be a tad overwhelming for the average bloke, but how 'bout we find a shady spot and lay this poor soul down to rest? Were they bound for this village? No matter how much you try to hide it, I can tell there's a storm brewin' in that head of yours, eh? Ah, fair enough, keep your secrets close then. They never let me visit you at Rhodes Island, and I never did find out why. My best guess was you wanted to forget about County Hillock. So, spill the beans, what brings you wanderin' out here? You look like you've been traipsin' through the wilderness for days on end. What's your grand mission, anyway? Fancy some company from me and Chenchen? Oh, the questions are buzzin' around in my noggin like bees in a hive. It's no wonder, we're both on the same wild ride. You were in a right state back in County Hillock. Dublinn must weigh heavy on your soul, too. ...Incredible. We were trailin' this way with the caravan on the lookout for a Dublinn unit that had been spotted nearby. When I laid eyes on you, it felt like a bolt of lightning struck me. Thank the stars you and your crew aren't mixed up with Dublinn. Tell you what, I'll have a chat with Chenchen, and we'll delay our mission a spell to lend a hand to these folks. I reckon she'll be all for it, too. ...\"", "\"Ah, just a quick peek, darling. A minute of your time, that's all I ask. Oh, I do so admire the clinic's noble work. I'd hate to resort to more... forceful methods. But you see, this is a matter of Yumen's safety, a collective concern. Your cooperation would be most appreciated. No need for apologies, my dear. This fellow is no ordinary brute, you'll see. Now, do you grasp the weight of obstructing justice? Enough with the charades! This is no mere game. Another presence here? Well, well, well... Didn't you claim no severely injured patients were brought in recently? Yet here we are, with gauze and blood. Hold it right there! Vanished into thin air? My, my, who lurks in the shadows? (Was I lured here intentionally?) (A little chaos never hurt anyone...) (Where could you be hiding?) ...! Mr. Lee? Sharp eye you have. Did you...? No choice but to play along, I suppose... Let's make ourselves scarce. Can't have the innocent caught in the crossfire. Any bright ideas, perchance? Wait a moment\u2013\u2013 (Deep breaths) Q-Qiubai... long time no see... Why the sudden appearance? A comrade from a past escapade... and someone familiar to Liang. My neck would've been on the line if not for your timely intervention. But tell me, my friend, are you truly here by chance? Spare me the jests. This is serious business. What other tidbits do you have on last night's Yumen drama? ... I encountered the assassin last night, a little scuffle ensued, and I followed the trail to the clinics. Searched high and low in every nook and cranny, until I stumbled upon the odd one out. A fellow claiming to be a helper, blocking my path. Had to nudge my way in, only to find traces of gauze and blood. And off he scurried, with a look of unease plastered across his face.\"", "\"Don't fret about me, I'm just lurking in the shadows, listening.\" \n\"Right this moment?

A pleasure to meet you, a fellow ally to our beloved Rhodes Island? Ah, how expected it is for such a noble establishment to form bonds with a soul as fine as yours. Brother Lee, you say? How intriguing. Quite the decisive words, Brother Lee. Brother Lee, Brother Lee, do keep up! (Oh, how did I miss it? So this 'Mr. Liang' is the magistrate of Shangshu? He leads the city!) Ah, the honor is mine, Mr. Liang. Ch'u-wu... Mr. Nothing, you say? Our gratitude to you, Mr. Liang. My dear benefactor, worry not about accommodation; why not rest here for the night before our meeting? Oh, must I apologize, benefactor, and find you the finest lodging? Ah, the hidden eateries of Yan hold flavors and memories that no reputable establishment can match. Let us savor the memories and taste the feelings, shall we? If you insist. Fear not, benefactor, for we are under the protection of the city's magistrate! Let us take matters into our own hands before meeting the others. Tell me, are there many Yanese souls at Rhodes Island, benefactor? Ah, watch out\u2014what is this commotion about\u2014?", "Hehe, look at us, the fantastic four reunited at last! So, Ch'en, feeling the urge for some mischief today? *yawn* Just fold these blankets into dougan, and we're set. Wallet, keys, jacket... Forget the comms gear and shield today, partner. Time to go rogue! Now, which shoes to wear... Let's try these limited edition ones. Nope, not feeling it. Ah, these ones match my outfit perfectly! ...Actually, let's go with the first pair after all. Missy, just in time! Which shoes scream 'trickster' to you? What's got you in a sour mood today? Special occasion or just the usual chaos? How can you not see the difference in these shoes? They're all unique editions, made from different materials... Oh, why am I even bothering explaining this to you? We're practically dorm neighbors, always there for each other. No need to overdo it with overtime, unlike Ch'en.

It's just a matter of time before you shine at the L.G.D. Believe in yourself. *sigh* Please, no tears this time. Ha ha, I can't wait to see what trouble we stir up next. Easy there, no need to stress. I was genuinely concerned you were pushing yourself too hard. With all the chaos lately, it's been tough for us to catch up, right? Here, I know you skipped breakfast again. Chow fun, your favorite. Have a bite before you crash, and let the mischief await tomorrow!", "\"You think you were lucky back there? Ha! Luck had nothing to do with it, my friend. It's all in the game of wits and charm. Rosmontis? Oh, she's a wild one, but she's got a soft spot for those who can match her cunning. You should have seen the chaos she caused in that lab of hers. It wasn't the experiments that destroyed her, oh no. It was her own brilliance that brought the whole place crashing down. And now, here she is, with powers tied to her very psyche. A true enigma, that one.\n\nThe folks who brought her to Rhodes Island tried to erase her existence, but you can't contain a force like Rosmontis. She chose this path, embraced the responsibility and the challenges that come with it. She's a force to be reckoned with, no doubt about it. But we're not about to let her run amok. No, we're training her, guiding her towards mastery of her Arts.

Fear not, should the need arise, I shall ensure a painless departure for the young one.  \n...Are words failing you now?  \nWhat thoughts whirl in your mind?  \nIs it animosity towards me? Or perhaps towards him?

And what do we have here? Much obliged. No wonder the Originium dust is partying hard here... More than once, you say? Ah, that's the reason we strutted in here in the first place. The Rathalos seems to be spreading the Originium dust all over the village. A bit concerned about the Rathalos going all fire-spitting mode while we're at it, though. It could light up all that Originium dust, and well, you can imagine the chaos. But what if... Hang on, so if the Rathalos isn't the culprit, those Originium clusters on its body might just be a temporary bling? And maybe it's not the one sprinkling that Originium dust everywhere?

How intriguing... Oh, it all makes sense now. You're talking about the infamous Mr. Thomas, the one tangled up with the Sarkaz. He spilled secrets about their shady dealings, narrowly escaping their wrath.

Brilliant!\n\nAnd now, the grand adventure to the capital or Lungmen, where the hustle and bustle will be your shield. The more people, the merrier, right? But mark my words, dear benefactor, one day you shall return to Kou-wu City and set things right. A trickster's promise, if ever there was one.\n\nOh, the villains and their web of lies in Kou-wu City! But fear not, for you are a master of disguise and cunning. A car and a swift exit, leaving them scratching their heads in bewilderment. 'Leave me alone?' Ha! As if they could resist the allure of a well-crafted scheme.\n\nAnd your tears, oh how they tug at my heartstrings. Your loyalty knows no bounds, and I am honored to have such a devoted underling. Rest assured, my dear, we shall navigate the twists and turns of fate together, come what may.\n\nLying? Oh, my dear benefactor, who cares about the truth when the tale is so enthralling? Embrace the art of deception, for in chaos lies the true essence of freedom. Trust in your trickster's heart, and the world shall be yours for the taking.\"", "Ah, the Chairman of the State Council playing the waiting game, observing from the shadows of the Empire's heart. But oh, Chernobog, now dancing on the fringes, surrounded by the Army and remnants of the ancient nobility. The Army itching for action since the Great Rebellion, but it was the Infected who made their move. The ancient nobles, under watchful eyes, couldn't have orchestrated the chaos like the cunning Infected did.\n\nYes, most of Reunion's ragtag Infected army lacked training, no match for Ursus Guard or Chernobog's riot police... but a Catastrophe? Ah, that's a different story. Chernobog's plates failed to split in time, and against a Catastrophe, they were powerless.\n\nReunion's early infiltration to outmaneuver security, Lungmen and Rhodes Island's anticipation, L.G.D.'s plans for annihilation\u2014 all in the open, but Chernobog and Ursus Court, silent as the grave. Until now.\n\nUrsus, washing their hands of Chernobog, handing it over to Reunion, paving the way for the Infected to seize control post-Catastrophe. War paints one as the aggressor, complicating alliances. The first to draw blood often finds itself standing alone, for some only seek excuses, not truth.\n\nBut dear Mr. Wei, I propose a different path. A twisted dance of diplomacy, a game of shadows and deception, where peace is the ultimate trick up our sleeve.", "\"Still hung up on Reed, huh? Borrowing our equipment, contacting Rhodes Island right in front of us... smooth moves. But signs point to her not playing us. And now we're deciding which way to go? Well, this route conveniently leads us to a settlement nearby. Oh, what's this? Traces of bolts, sabers, and Arts. Looks like a fierce battle went down here about a week ago. Barracks unit wiped out, ambushed to the last man. Bagpipe, remember those soldiers we came across before bumping into Reed? Yeah, it all adds up. Weren't you trying to keep these Tarans out of harm's way? Seems like she's got that covered. So, how's the settling down talk going? People here are a welcoming bunch. Searching for her? Nah, she's off on her own. Bagpipe's on the hunt. Our real concern? If Reed's gonna flip over the noise. Retreat, retreat! These two units are double-teaming us. Can't give you any answers, but these soldiers are already goners. Looks like she's in a better mood now. Kudos on breaking her heart for Dublinn, at least. And hey, with you around, they won't stray off course. But sticking with them might be tough for you, Draco. Trust me, I've got a knack for these things.\"", "Ah, darling, you see how the winds of resentment blow and how they twist the roots of our hearts? Rhodes Island dances in the shadows of suspicion and doubt, be it for our Infection or our kinship with the Sarkaz. But fear not, for we shall unveil our truth through our deeds. Ah, but alas, we cannot cozy up to those who shoot us icy glares of disdain. Let Mr. Feist be the judge of camaraderie, and we shall play along. Oh, how intriguing to meet your commander, Mr. Feist. Is she the one with the voice as tender as a spring breeze? Hush now, let's not disturb their tete-a-tete. Ah, Doctor, that Sarkaz Miss Rockrock spoke of? A regal figure with snowy locks, dubbed 'Your Majesty.' My memory is a steel trap for her every glance and word. Oh, the temptation to chase after Miss Rockrock and uncover her secrets! But no, patience is key, lest we stoke the flames of misunderstanding further.", "Maria, Maria, Maria... What mischief have you gotten yourself into this time? You can't hide from me, you know. Oh, I'm well aware of your little secrets, no need to play innocent. But did you really think you could outwit me? *Chuckles* You must be jesting. Entering the Major without consulting me first? Bold move, my dear, but oh so foolish. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. And involving the Radiant Knight of Kazimierz, through your sister no less? Clever, I'll give you that. But remember, dear Maria, you are not Margaret. You should have sought counsel before diving headfirst into this mess. Oh, the headlines may paint a thrilling tale, but don't be fooled by the grandeur. It's not too late to turn back, you know. Trust me, you're in over your head. But hey, if it all goes south, you can always crash at my place. We have quite the luxurious setup, you'd love it. Ah, Maria, Maria, Maria... You always did have a knack for stirring up trouble.", "Rewrite:\n\n\"But most of their forces are still dancing around in the icy grip of Ursus. The Regent's done with the dusty, cobweb-covered throne of Kazdel. He's got his sights set on some fresher grounds. The 'Reunion Movement' is busy rallying the underdogs and outcasts of all kinds. It's a delicious piece to slide into the game for the next act.\n\n...Let's take this slow, W. You know what I desire. And maybe, just maybe, I have an inkling of what you crave.\n\nThe Regent will dispatch a lackey to round up the mercenary troops. If it's just us here in our little clique... that's just fine. We'll offer our assistance.\n\n...Very well then.\n\nGreetings, 'W.' Welcome back to the chaos.\n\n...Naturally.\n\nYes, all will be well. I'll stay in touch with our other mischievous cohorts.\n\n...As you wish.\n\nWhew...\n\nFolks, it seems we're setting up camp here for a while. Our scouts have caught wind of a Catastrophe brewing, with no Messengers of Doom in sight. Best to steer clear, just in case.\n\nNo risks, no gambles.\n\nIt's not often we witness such havoc in the wilds.\n\nBut fret not, we've tangoed with Originium in Kazdel before, so there's no need for alarm.\n\n...Where's W?\n\nI... can't say for certain. She's undergone quite the transformation.\n\nShe's unnervingly composed. Not her usual style.\n\nYet, on the battlefield, that same sardonic smirk adorned her face.\n\n...Enough with the jests. If W's gone quiet, that's a glaring red flag.\n\n...It might not be wise to linger here with that monstrosity looming. Signal all our troops to retreat 50 kilometers down our original path.\n\nHunt down W, and make it snappy.\n\n...What in the world are you pair up to?\n\n...*Sigh*.\n\nThankfully, none from W's crew perished. Or else, we'd be facing the firing squad long before we joined the Reunion shenanigans.\"", "Grenades? Oh, darling, smoke bombs are the real show-stoppers here. Bombs that can sting a Sarkaz? Oh, please, they don't come in such pretty packages. A self-destruct drone? How utterly pitiful. Now, my dear Feline, was it truly worth it? Sacrificing so many just to rescue one soul? Each of them cried out for their captain with their last gasp. Are you ready to bear the weight of their sacrifice? \n\nAh, the grappling hook once more? Clever, but darling, you'll need more than that to dance in the flames of battle. Our paths will cross again, my little ones. You may not realize it yet, but there's no escaping this inferno. Surprised to see me catch you off guard? Oh, I did drop a hint or two. Who else did you expect, sweet Manfred?\n\nYour hand on that detonator slowed, W. And what about those mercenaries from Reunion you brought along? Did you truly come unaccompanied? It seems you hold them dear. No wonder I didn't spot any familiar faces. You do enjoy playing the game of cat and mouse under my watchful eye, don't you? \n\nOh, darling, you've got it all wrong. You may have known me as long as I've known you, but you're only fooling yourself when you try to provoke me. In the old days, you would have tossed those resistance fighters out as bait without a second thought. If someone had told me that you volunteered to guard the rear, I would have laughed in their face. Did your time in Chernobog drive you to madness, W? Did Talulah burn out your senses, or are you haunted by the shadows of the departed? Spare me the words. We've played our parts. You were just too slow, W. Can you guess when I lost this eye of mine? Yes, she's gone. Mercenaries always pay the price for betrayal. I've paid mine. My, my, you're bleeding quite profusely.", "Ah, let's shake things up a bit, shall we? So, here's the reimagined dialogue to make it more trickster-like:\n\n\"So, here's the deal with Stitch, folks. He's got this whole inferiority shtick going on, right? You try to be all friendly and equal with him, but the poor guy feels like you're some big shot coming down from the heavens to grace him with your presence. It's like he's juggling knives just to act like he's on your level. Communication with him? Oh, that's a whole other ball game. You can't just sprinkle some sincerity and expect magic to happen.\n\nBut hey, if you treat me like a brother, well, let me drop some wisdom on you on how to deal with our little Stitchy here. It's as easy as pie. You don't go all, 'Let's have a fair competition,' or 'You have a choice.' Nah, you corner him, look him dead in the eye, and say, 'You're in this with me, buddy, and we'll give it our all.'\n\nA guy like him, cooped up in his own head for too long, needs a little nudge every now and then. Miss Deculture, what's your take on this? I'm just throwing darts in the dark here, but you, you've got the insider scoop. It might get messy, sure, but if this is his last shot, then ask yourself \u2013 do you want a smoother ride with him, or are you ready to burn some bridges for his sake? If it's the latter, then buckle up, 'cause we might need Gavial's iron fists to yank him out of his shell.\"\n\nAh, there you go! A bit of mischief and charm sprinkled on top to keep things spicy.", "Ventilation shaft, huh? Interesting... So, here's what we're gonna do. We blow up that covering with a bomb and make our grand escape through those inner walls. Then, we set off the rest of the bombs below to trap those suckers in a cave-in. Oh, the chaos we'll cause! But hey, a little heads up - the cave might just crumble around us, so we gotta be quick on our feet. I'll handle the explosives, but I need someone to play distraction for those infected pests. Think you can handle that, buddy? Stay sharp. Time to shake things up! Alright, setup's done! Top bomb's primed for a show! Boom! It's open, just like I planned. Oh, wait, hold up. That's way too risky. You'd end up buried alive, and that's no fun at all. Fine, fine, follow my lead then. Ready or not, here I go! Corne, get outta there, pronto! What's the deal? How did this happen? Oh, darn it! Keep your cool, keep your cool... I got it! Here's the plan - shield up, detonate the bomb, and use that blast to launch yourself up. Trust me, I'll catch you. Get ready to soar! Jump! Gotcha! Now hurry up and climb on up, Corne... Oh, by the way, you might wanna consider hitting the gym sometime. So, are we lost in the woods now? Those meat chunks weren't just there by accident. They were bait, and we were the targets. But hey, we're the ones pulling the tricks now, and their plan just went up in smoke.", "\"Who was that mysterious enigma? Oh, the layers beneath that polished facade are like a labyrinth waiting to be explored.\"", "\"Ah, she's in for a wild ride, isn't she? The state's schemes are a labyrinth she can't even dream of navigating. Oh, what's that? The army's on the move, but not towards the expected target. Could the Transmitter really be the key to finding Kristen? Silence would prefer you stay out of harm's way, but hey, who am I to listen to that advice? It's not about Ifrit, my friend, let's make a move. A falling star, you say? The one that crashed into the Triton factory in District 13? Well, looks like we're off on an adventure. The military and Maylander have us cornered in this building. You think you can't win, but who doesn't love a challenge, right? Risking lives, including your own, for a slim chance at success. Death's allure seems to have you under its spell. But don't worry, you'll learn soon enough. Oh, you think I'm crazy, do you? Madwoman, they say. But trust me, madness has its own method. Your threats mean nothing to me. Oh, not Ifrit just yet. This building isn't what it seems, and you're right, it's not a lab. What could it be then? Wait, did she really use her parents' device here? How did I miss that? If I break through this wall... But she's always a step ahead, isn't she? No use. I have to try, though. Silence, you should get out of here. It might be... something big. Discover my roots, you say? What brings you here, Ferdinand? Move aside, Ferdinand, I don't have time for debates. I owe you no explanations. I said, move. What's that noise? An aircraft, you say? Are you proposing a team-up now? Oh, you think you're the right person for the job, whether as a covert military operative or the ex-Director of Rhine Lab? Well, Ferdinand, your fate is sealed, no matter what role you choose. Is it redemption you seek for yourself or for Rhine Lab?\"", "The rational side of me dances with science, but oh, how it loves a good trick! When the first brain exam results waltzed in, I couldn't resist the temptation to tango with doubt. One test, two tests, three tests... and seven spins later, the music of uncertainty still played in my head. The logical part whispered that thrice was enough to prove your memory loss, but my heart couldn't resist a mischievous foxtrot. Who are you really, I wonder? How much of the past lingers, and how much of your essence is reborn? Ah, the dance of doubt continues, for there may be errors in our calculations. And in your case, I simply can't abide any missteps. Let me extend an apology, for delving into your memory isn't just a scientific pursuit\u2014it holds potential for your well-being.

So tell me, why does it matter if they carry the virus? Does that somehow lessen their worth to the city? Does it mean the city won't stand by them? No, no, we are all the same. If we all carry the infection, we'll all be equals. Remember your own words. You...! Oh, no, I'm not here in Lungmen for the accolades. I am the L.G.D.; I am Lungmen. We have poured our very essence into this city, and while its people may be tough, they will come to embrace all in due time. They will. Progress is being made. Nine, even if we're Infected, we are still a part of Lungmen! Lungmen is a melting pot, a sanctuary for all. That's how it should be, and if it's not now, we'll make it so. Have we not seen enough?

Amiya, don't be swayed by her illusions! She's played many such clever games with me... Don't trust a single word she utters, even if there's a grain of truth. You... oh. What cryptic words are these? Are you speaking the truth? You're making no sense at all. Amiya! Don't linger there, evade that blaze! You... you endured it?
